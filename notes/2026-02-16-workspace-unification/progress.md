### Iteration 1 — Create graft-common crate with timeout-protected command execution
**Status**: completed
**Files changed**:
- `crates/graft-common/Cargo.toml` (new)
- `crates/graft-common/src/lib.rs` (new)
- `crates/graft-common/src/command.rs` (new)
- `Cargo.toml` (added graft-common to workspace)
- `Cargo.lock` (updated)

**What was done**:
Created the new `graft-common` crate as a workspace member with timeout-protected command execution functionality. Extracted and generalized the `run_git_with_timeout` pattern from `grove-engine/src/git.rs` into `run_command_with_timeout`. The new function accepts an optional environment variable name for timeout configuration (supporting both `GROVE_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS` for backwards compatibility and future `GRAFT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS`). Added 6 unit tests covering success, timeout, spawn failure, nonzero exit, and environment variable handling.

**Critique findings**:
Doc comment on `run_command_with_timeout` was misleading - it said the command "must have stdout/stderr configured" but the function itself configures them. This could confuse users about whether they need to pre-configure these.

**Improvements made**:
Updated documentation to clarify that the function configures stdout/stderr piping, so callers don't need to.

**Learnings for future iterations**:
- The workspace already has `wait-timeout`, `thiserror`, and `log` as workspace dependencies, so adding them to new crates is straightforward.
- The crate passes all checks in isolation even though the workspace has pre-existing clippy issues in `grove-cli/src/tui.rs`.
- When testing new crates in isolation, use `cd crates/<crate-name> && cargo test` to avoid workspace-wide clippy errors.
