Perfect! Task 8 is complete. Let me provide a summary to the user:

## Task 8 Complete: Deduplicated graft.yaml parsing

I've successfully extracted shared graft.yaml parsing utilities into `graft-common` and migrated both grove-cli and grove-engine to use them.

### What was done:

1. **Created `graft-common/src/config.rs`** with:
   - `CommandDef` and `StateQueryDef` types representing parsed YAML structures
   - `parse_commands()` - parses the `commands:` section from graft.yaml
   - `parse_state_queries()` - parses the `state:` section from graft.yaml
   - 8 unit tests covering success cases, missing files, and defaults

2. **Migrated grove-cli** (`state/discovery.rs`):
   - Replaced ~70 lines of duplicate parsing logic with a ~20 line wrapper
   - Now delegates to `graft_common::parse_state_queries()`
   - All existing tests still pass

3. **Migrated grove-engine** (`config.rs`):
   - Updated `GraftYamlConfigLoader` to use `graft_common::parse_commands()`
   - Maintains the `GraftYaml` return type for backward compatibility
   - All tests pass

### Results:

- ✅ Eliminated ~80 lines of duplicate YAML parsing code
- ✅ Both tools now share the same parsing implementation
- ✅ All 420+ tests passing
- ✅ Modified crates pass clippy and formatting checks
- ✅ Committed with clean history (2 commits: implementation + docs)

The task is complete and ready for the next iteration!
