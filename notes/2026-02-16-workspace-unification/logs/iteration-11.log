Perfect! Task 11 is now complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 11 Complete: Update Entrypoints

I've successfully updated all project entrypoint documents to reflect the current state after workspace unification:

### Changes Made

**AGENTS.md:**
- Documented `graft-common` crate with details about what it provides (timeout-protected commands, git ops, state types, config parsing)
- Updated test count from 49 to 423 tests across workspace
- Changed status from "ready for use" to "production ready"
- Marked Python implementation as deprecated throughout
- Updated Graft Rust implementation status to note workspace unification completion

**CLAUDE.md:**
- Updated verification command test counts (423 Rust tests, 485 Python tests)
- Updated Python description from "legacy, maintained for compatibility" to "deprecated, maintained for reference"

**continue-here.md:**
- Complete rewrite reflecting current state as of 2026-02-16
- Rust CLI clearly marked as primary implementation
- Python CLI marked as deprecated with migration guide reference
- Documented workspace unification completion and graft-common crate
- Added comprehensive session handoff context including:
  - Current state of both Graft and Grove
  - Quick start commands for both Rust and Python
  - Updated project structure showing graft-common
  - Clear metrics (423 Rust tests, 485 Python tests)
  - Architecture patterns for both implementations
  - Next steps pointing to remaining tasks

**knowledge-base.yaml:**
- Already updated in Task 10 with graft-common component

### Verification

- ✅ All 423 workspace tests pass
- ✅ No broken links in any updated files
- ✅ Test counts verified against actual test runs
- ✅ All references to "rewrite in progress" removed
- ✅ Consistent language across all three files

The next task (Task 12) is to add lifecycle frontmatter to all documentation files.
