Perfect! Task 12 is complete. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

**Task 12 completed successfully: Add lifecycle frontmatter to all documentation files**

### What was done:
- Added YAML frontmatter to 11 documentation files that lacked proper lifecycle metadata
- Converted inline status markers (e.g., `**Status**: Accepted`) to structured YAML frontmatter
- Files updated:
  - `docs/architecture.md` - Added `status: stable`
  - `docs/decisions/README.md` - Added `status: stable`  
  - 6 ADRs in `docs/decisions/` - Converted to `status: accepted`
  - `docs/guides/grove-user-guide.md` - Added `status: stable`
  - 2 Grove implementation docs - Added proper frontmatter with status

### Verification:
- ✅ All 423 Rust workspace tests pass
- ✅ All documentation files now have valid YAML frontmatter with status field
- ✅ No broken links created
- ✅ Consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD) used throughout
- ✅ Pre-existing clippy warnings in grove-cli TUI remain as expected

### Commits:
1. `e37c356` - Added lifecycle frontmatter to documentation files
2. `67966fb` - Updated plan and progress tracking

The implementation follows meta-KB lifecycle policy and maintains consistency with existing documentation patterns. All acceptance criteria met with no issues requiring fixes.
