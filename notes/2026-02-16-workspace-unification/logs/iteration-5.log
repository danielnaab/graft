Excellent! The commit sequence is clean:
1. Implementation commit: "feat(graft): migrate grove-engine to use graft-common command execution"
2. Documentation commit: "docs: Update plan and progress for Task 5 completion"

This matches the workflow prescribed in the prompt. Task 5 is complete and the next iteration will pick up Task 6.

## Summary

**Task 5: Migrate grove-engine to use `graft-common` command execution** ✅

Successfully migrated grove-engine to use the shared timeout-protected command runner from graft-common. The implementation:
- Replaced a 50-line local implementation with a clean thin wrapper (22 lines gained, 50 removed = net -28 lines)
- Preserved all existing behavior and API contracts
- Maintained the `GROVE_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable support
- All 40 grove-engine tests pass without modification
- Removed `wait-timeout` as a direct dependency (now comes via graft-common)

The thin wrapper pattern proved ideal for this migration - it converts domain-agnostic `CommandError` to grove-specific `CoreError` while delegating all execution logic to the shared implementation. This makes the migration low-risk and preserves the existing API for all 6 call sites in grove-engine.
