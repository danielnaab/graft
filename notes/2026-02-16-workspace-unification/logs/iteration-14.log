Perfect! Task 14 is now complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 14 Complete: Authority Boundaries and Link Fixes

Successfully completed Task 14 with all acceptance criteria met:

### What Was Fixed

**Broken Links (11 total):**
- Fixed 7 broken specification links in `docs/grove/planning/roadmap.md` (wrong relative path depth)
- Fixed 2 broken specification links in `docs/grove/planning/slices/slice-1-workspace-config.md`
- Fixed 2 broken rust-starter architecture links (wrong subdirectory path)

**Authority Notes Added:**
- `docs/architecture.md` - Added note clarifying relationship to canonical specs
- `docs/grove-overview.md` - Added note pointing to Grove specifications
- `docs/guides/grove-user-guide.md` - Added note referencing canonical requirements
- `docs/cli-reference.md` - Enhanced existing note to be clearer
- `docs/grove/implementation/architecture-overview.md` - Added note referencing Grove specs

### Key Outcomes

✅ **No broken links** - All internal documentation links now resolve correctly
✅ **Authority boundaries explicit** - Interpretation documents clearly reference canonical sources  
✅ **No file:/// issues** - Only legitimate examples in configuration docs
✅ **Verification passed** - All 423 tests pass, format/clippy clean (except pre-existing TUI issues)

### Commits
1. `08e003d` - Implementation: Fixed links and added authority notes
2. `3390be6` - Documentation: Updated plan and progress log

The repository documentation now has consistent authority boundaries and all internal links are verified to work correctly. Ready for Task 15 (ADR creation) next.
