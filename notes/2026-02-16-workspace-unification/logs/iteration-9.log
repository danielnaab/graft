Perfect! Task 9 is complete. The Python implementation is now clearly marked as deprecated with:
- A comprehensive `DEPRECATED.md` explaining the migration path
- Deprecation notices in module docstrings
- Runtime warnings when the CLI is invoked
- Updated package metadata in `pyproject.toml`

All 485 Python tests continue to pass, confirming that the deprecation notices don't break any functionality.

The next task (Task 10) is to merge grove docs into the main documentation tree. This is a more complex documentation reorganization task that will require careful link updates.
