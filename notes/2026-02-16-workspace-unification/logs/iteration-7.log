Excellent! Task 7 has been completed successfully. 

## Summary

I successfully migrated state query consumers to use `graft-common` types:

### Changes Made:
1. **grove-cli**: 
   - Added `graft-common` dependency
   - Replaced duplicate `StateMetadata` and `StateResult` types with re-exports from `graft-common`
   - Replaced cache functions with wrappers that maintain backward compatibility (accepting pre-computed workspace hashes)
   - Updated module exports

2. **graft-engine**:
   - Replaced duplicate `StateMetadata` and `StateResult` types with re-exports from `graft-common`
   - Replaced cache read/write/invalidate functions with thin wrappers that delegate to `graft-common`
   - Kept graft-specific execution logic (`execute_state_query`, `get_state`)

### Key Decisions:
- Grove-cli wrappers maintain API compatibility by accepting pre-computed workspace hashes (as expected by existing tests)
- Both crates now share the same cache directory structure and types, ensuring consistency
- Removed ~338 lines of duplicate code

### Verification:
- ✅ All 420+ tests pass
- ✅ No duplicate `StateMetadata`/`StateResult` definitions
- ✅ Format and clippy pass for modified packages
- ✅ Pre-existing TUI clippy issues are documented and unrelated to this migration

The next task in the plan is **Task 8: Deduplicate graft.yaml command/state parsing**.
