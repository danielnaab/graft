Task 9 is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Task 9: Command Palette — Completed

**What was built:**

1. **`PALETTE_COMMANDS` registry** in `command_line.rs` — 6 entries (`help`, `quit`, `refresh`, `repo`, `run`, `state`) with short descriptions. `filtered_palette(filter)` returns a `Vec<&'static PaletteEntry>` filtered by case-insensitive substring match.

2. **`palette_selected: usize`** added to `CommandLineState` to track which palette entry is highlighted.

3. **Palette navigation keys** in `handle_key_command_line`:
   - `j`/Down — move selection down (wraps from last→first)
   - `k`/Up — move selection up (wraps from first→last)
   - `Enter` on empty buffer — fills command line with selected entry, leaves it open for arguments
   - `Enter` on non-empty buffer — submits as before
   - Typing/Backspace — resets `palette_selected` to 0 (list re-filters)

4. **`render_command_palette()`** in `render.rs` — draws a bordered popup anchored to the bottom-left of the content area (just above the status bar). Shows filtered entries with the selected one highlighted in cyan.

5. **14 new tests** covering: palette filtering, case-insensitivity, j/k/arrow navigation, wraparound, Enter-fills vs. Enter-submits, typing/backspace resetting selection, Esc dismissal.
