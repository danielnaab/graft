Perfect! All verification passes. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

**Task 6: `graft resolve` command** has been successfully completed.

### Implementation Highlights:

**Core Resolution Logic (graft-engine/resolution.rs):**
- Implements flat-only dependency resolution using git submodules
- 8 git operation functions (is_submodule, add_submodule, update_submodule, fetch_all, resolve_ref, get_current_commit, checkout)
- `resolve_dependency()`: Handles existing submodules, legacy clones, and new additions
- `resolve_all_dependencies()`: Processes all dependencies, continues on failure
- `resolve_and_create_lock()`: Resolves dependencies AND updates graft.lock (critical)

**CLI Command:**
- Clean output showing configuration, resolution progress, and lock file update
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure
- Helpful error messages with suggestions for common issues

**All 6 Acceptance Criteria Met:**
1. ✅ Clones dependencies to `.graft/<name>/` as git submodules
2. ✅ Checks out declared ref
3. ✅ Skips already-resolved dependencies
4. ✅ Reports status for each dependency
5. ✅ Exit code 0 on success, 1 on partial failure
6. ✅ Creates/updates graft.lock (added after self-critique)

**Self-Critique Process:**
The self-critique identified a critical gap: the initial implementation did not update the lock file, which is required by the spec. This was fixed in a second commit by adding `resolve_and_create_lock()` that ensures the lock file accurately reflects the resolved state.

**Verification:**
- ✅ All tests pass (31 tests)
- ✅ No clippy warnings
- ✅ Manual testing confirms correct behavior
- ✅ Lock file correctly updated with current timestamps and commit hashes

The implementation follows established patterns from prior tasks and integrates cleanly with the existing codebase.
