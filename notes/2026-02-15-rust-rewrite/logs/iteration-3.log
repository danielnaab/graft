Perfect! Task 5 is now complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 5 Complete: `graft validate` Command

I've successfully implemented the `graft validate` command with all acceptance criteria met:

### What was built:
1. **Validation module** (`crates/graft-engine/src/validation.rs`):
   - `validate_config_schema()` - checks business rules (at least one dependency required)
   - `validate_integrity()` - verifies .graft/ directory matches lock file by comparing commit hashes
   - Uses `git rev-parse HEAD` to get current commit from each dependency

2. **CLI command** (`crates/graft-cli/src/main.rs`):
   - Three validation modes: `--config`, `--lock`, `--integrity` (or all if no flags)
   - Both text and JSON output formats
   - Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (validation error), 2 (integrity mismatch)
   - Reports ALL errors, not just the first one

### Verified against this repo:
```bash
$ cargo run -p graft-cli -- validate
Validating graft.yaml...
  ✓ Schema is valid

Validating graft.lock...
  ✓ Schema is valid

Validating integrity...
  ✓ living-specifications: Commit matches
  ✓ meta-knowledge-base: Commit matches
  ✓ python-starter: Commit matches
  ✓ rust-starter: Commit matches

Validation successful
```

### Test results:
- ✅ All 28 graft-engine tests pass (4 new validation tests)
- ✅ Cargo clippy passes with no warnings
- ✅ Manual testing confirms all three modes work correctly
- ✅ JSON output format works as expected

The implementation follows the established patterns from prior tasks and integrates cleanly with the existing codebase. Ready for the next task!
