Excellent! The commit structure is clean:
1. Implementation commit: `b337781 feat(graft): add end-to-end integration tests for graft CLI`
2. Documentation commit: `28e5ca1 docs: Update plan and progress for Task 13 completion`

## Summary

I have successfully completed **Task 13: End-to-end integration tests** from the graft Rust implementation plan.

### What was accomplished:

**Implemented 7 comprehensive integration tests** in `crates/graft-cli/tests/integration_test.rs`:
1. ✅ Test resolves repository's own graft.yaml dependencies  
2. ✅ Test status → resolve → status round-trip workflow
3. ✅ Test upgrade with rollback on verification failure
4. ✅ Test validate command error detection
5. ✅ Test changes and show commands
6. ✅ Test add and remove dependency management
7. ✅ Test fetch and sync operations

### Verification:
- All 7 tests pass: `cargo test -p graft-cli`
- All graft crates pass: `cargo clippy -p graft-core -p graft-engine -p graft-cli -- -D warnings`
- Code properly formatted: `cargo fmt --check`
- 547 lines of test code with proper helper functions

### Key features:
- Tests use real git repositories created in temporary directories
- Tests verify file system state (lock files, .graft directories, graft.yaml modifications)
- Tests validate both success and failure paths (including rollback)
- Clean helper functions for code reuse
- Proper test isolation using `tempfile::TempDir`

### Discovered insight:
Found a limitation in the upgrade CLI - it reads graft.yaml before checking out the target ref. Worked around in tests by including future change declarations. This could be improved in future iterations but is not blocking.

All acceptance criteria are genuinely met. The implementation is clean, idiomatic Rust following established patterns from the grove-cli tests.
