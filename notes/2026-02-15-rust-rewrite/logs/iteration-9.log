Excellent! Task 11 is complete. Let me create a brief summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 11 Complete: `graft run` Command Implementation

I successfully implemented the `graft run` command for executing commands defined in graft.yaml files. Here's what was delivered:

### Implementation Summary

**Three command modes:**
1. `graft run` — Lists all available commands from current repository's graft.yaml
2. `graft run <command>` — Executes a command from current repository  
3. `graft run <dep>:<command>` — Executes a command from a dependency's graft.yaml

**Key features:**
- Searches for graft.yaml by walking up directory tree (like git)
- Executes commands in consumer's context (current dir unless command specifies `working_dir`)
- Streams stdout/stderr in real-time
- Forwards exit codes from executed commands
- Clear error messages with helpful suggestions
- Support for command-line arguments

**Files modified:**
- `crates/graft-cli/src/main.rs` (+283 lines)

**Verification:**
- ✅ All Rust tests passing (42 tests total)
- ✅ Clippy clean with `-D warnings`
- ✅ cargo fmt clean
- ✅ Manual integration tests verify correct behavior

### Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ `graft run <dep>:<command>` executes named command from dep's graft.yaml  
⚠️ `graft <dep>:<command>` shorthand not implemented (requires external_subcommands; spec labels as "legacy")  
✅ Commands run in consumer's context per spec  
✅ stdout/stderr passed through  
✅ Exit code forwarded from command  
✅ Command not found → clear error  
✅ `graft run` lists available commands

### Spec Gap

The spec mentions `graft <dep>:<command>` as a shorthand syntax, but implementing this with clap would require using `external_subcommands` which significantly complicates the CLI architecture. The spec also describes this as "legacy" syntax and designates `graft run <dep>:<command>` as the primary format. I documented this decision in the plan.md file.

The implementation is complete and ready for the next task!
