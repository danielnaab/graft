Excellent! The commits are properly separated:
1. `49726a3` - Implementation commit
2. `f6a0d0f` - Documentation commit (plan.md and progress.md updates)

## Summary

Task 3 (`graft status`) has been successfully completed. The implementation:

**What was delivered:**
- Query service in `crates/graft-engine/src/query.rs` with functions `get_all_status()` and `get_dependency_status()`
- CLI status command in `crates/graft-cli/src/main.rs` supporting both text and JSON output
- Full test coverage with 4 unit tests
- Integration tested against the repo's own `graft.lock` file

**Key fixes made:**
- Corrected query module implementation to use proper domain types (`GitRef`, `GitUrl`, `CommitHash`)
- Fixed field name mismatches (`git_ref` not `ref_name`)
- Changed timestamp handling from `DateTime<Utc>` to `String` to match domain model
- Used `IndexMap` for guaranteed alphabetical ordering in output
- Fixed clippy warnings and removed unused dependencies

**All acceptance criteria met:**
✅ Shows each dependency with current ref, locked commit, and sync status  
✅ Supports `--json` output format per spec  
✅ Exit code 0 on success  
✅ Works against this repo's graft.lock successfully

The next task in the plan is **Task 4: `graft changes` and `graft show`**.
