Perfect! Task 4 is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

**Task 4: `graft changes` and `graft show` - COMPLETED**

I successfully implemented the change listing and detail display functionality for graft:

### What was built:

1. **Query functions in graft-engine** (`query.rs`):
   - `get_changes_for_dependency()` - Get all changes from a dependency's config
   - `filter_changes_by_type()` - Filter by type (breaking, feature, fix, etc.)
   - `filter_breaking_changes()` - Filter to breaking changes only
   - `get_change_by_ref()` - Look up specific change
   - `get_change_details()` - Get change with resolved command details
   - `ChangeDetails` struct for structured results

2. **CLI commands in graft-cli** (`main.rs`):
   - `graft changes <dep>` - Lists changes from dependency's graft.yaml
     - `--type <type>` - Filter by change type
     - `--breaking` - Show only breaking changes
     - `--format text/json` - Output format
   - `graft show <dep>@<ref>` - Shows detailed change information
     - Displays type, description, migration/verify commands
     - `--format text/json` - Output format

### Verification results:
- ✅ All 49 tests passing (8 new tests for change queries)
- ✅ Cargo fmt: passed
- ✅ Cargo clippy: passed (graft crates only)
- ✅ Manual testing: commands work correctly with real dependencies
- ✅ All 5 acceptance criteria met

### Key patterns established:
- Query functions take `&GraftConfig`, return owned data
- CLI handles file I/O, calls query functions, formats output
- Consistent error handling and JSON output across commands
- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` acceptable for display functions

The implementation is complete, tested, and ready for the next task.
