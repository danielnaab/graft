This is just a formatting change from cargo fmt. This was already present when I started (as noted in gitStatus). I won't commit it since it's unrelated to my work. The task is complete!

## Summary

I successfully implemented **Task 7: `graft fetch` and `graft sync`** commands. Here's what was accomplished:

### Implementation Summary

**Fetch Command (`graft fetch`)**:
- Updates remote refs without changing checked-out commits
- Can fetch a single dependency or all dependencies
- Clear status reporting with helpful error messages
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure

**Sync Command (`graft sync`)**:
- Syncs `.graft/` directory to match `graft.lock` state
- Handles three scenarios: submodules, legacy clones, missing dependencies
- Clones missing dependencies, checks out correct commits for existing ones
- Does NOT run migrations (as specified in the spec)
- Clear status reporting with action differentiation (cloned, checked_out, up_to_date)

### Files Modified
- `crates/graft-engine/src/resolution.rs` (+223 lines)
- `crates/graft-engine/src/lib.rs` (exports)
- `crates/graft-cli/src/main.rs` (+144 lines)

### Verification
- ✅ All tests pass (56 tests total)
- ✅ Cargo fmt passes
- ✅ Cargo clippy passes with no warnings
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Spec compliance verified
- ✅ Self-critique completed with one minor issue fixed

### Commits
1. `271e346` - feat(graft): Implement fetch and sync commands
2. `3bc617b` - fix(graft): Remove redundant if-else in sync command display
3. `3b745f6` - docs: Update plan and progress for Task 7 completion

The implementation follows all established patterns from prior iterations and is ready for the next task!
