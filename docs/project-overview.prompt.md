Create a comprehensive project overview for Graft that synthesizes information from all source documents.

This overview should serve as both:
1. A complete introduction for new users who want to understand the project quickly
2. A demonstration of Graft itself - showing how it generates valuable documentation from sources

Structure the overview as:

## What is Graft?

Brief, compelling description of the tool and its purpose. Explain the core value proposition.

## Key concepts

Synthesize the most important architectural concepts from how-it-works.md:
- Change detection (source changes vs prompt changes)
- Actions (GENERATE, UPDATE, RESTYLE, REFRESH, MAINTAIN)
- Multi-level DAGs
- Auto-generated dvc.yaml

Explain these clearly but concisely.

## Quick start

Provide a streamlined getting started flow, drawing from getting-started.md. Include:
- Prerequisites
- Installation
- Creating first document
- Basic workflow

Keep this practical and actionable.

## Common workflows

Extract and present the most valuable workflows from command-reference.md. Focus on:
- Day-to-day usage patterns
- How to iterate on documents
- How to structure documentation hierarchies

## Configuration essentials

Summarize the most important configuration options from configuration.md:
- AWS credentials
- Model selection
- Dependency specification

Skip exhaustive details - link to configuration.md for complete reference.

## Troubleshooting highlights

Include the top 3-4 most common issues from troubleshooting.md with brief solutions.

## This document itself

End with a brief note explaining that this overview was generated by Graft from the source documents listed above. This demonstrates the tool's capability to synthesize multiple sources into coherent documentation.

Keep the tone professional and clear. Avoid unnecessary jargon. Make every sentence valuable. The goal is fast reading with high information density.
