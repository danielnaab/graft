# Recommendations: Graft Dependency Management Improvements

## Purpose

This document proposes specific improvements to Graft based on the experience of upgrading to graft-knowledge v2 specifications. The recommendations focus on making dependency management smoother, more intuitive, and better aligned with Graft's philosophy.

## Status

⚠️ **This document will be populated after implementation and analysis are complete.**

See:
- [Implementation Plan](./upgrade-to-graft-knowledge-v2.md)
- [Upgrade Analysis](./upgrade-analysis.md)

## Recommendation Framework

Each recommendation follows this structure:

1. **Problem Statement**: What pain point does this address?
2. **Current State**: How does Graft currently handle this?
3. **Proposed Solution**: What should change?
4. **Design Considerations**: What options exist? What are the trade-offs?
5. **Implementation Notes**: How would this be built?
6. **Success Criteria**: How would we measure improvement?
7. **Priority**: High/Medium/Low based on impact and effort

## Recommendations

## Prioritization

### High Priority
*(Recommendations with immediate impact and clear implementation path)*

- [Recommendation X]: [Brief reason]
- [Recommendation Y]: [Brief reason]

### Medium Priority
*(Valuable improvements that can wait for next phase)*

- [Recommendation X]: [Brief reason]
- [Recommendation Y]: [Brief reason]

### Low Priority
*(Nice-to-haves or experimental ideas)*

- [Recommendation X]: [Brief reason]
- [Recommendation Y]: [Brief reason]

## Implementation Roadmap

*(Suggested order of implementation based on dependencies and priorities)*

### Phase 1: Quick Wins
*(1-2 weeks of work)*

- [Recommendation X]
- [Recommendation Y]

### Phase 2: Foundation
*(2-4 weeks of work)*

- [Recommendation X]
- [Recommendation Y]

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
*(4-8 weeks of work)*

- [Recommendation X]
- [Recommendation Y]

## Alignment with Graft Philosophy

Each recommendation should align with Graft's core principles:

- **Knowledge dependency management**: Focus on knowledge bases, not just code
- **Reproducibility**: Clear, auditable dependency states
- **Transparency**: No magic, inspectable structures
- **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing operations with rollback
- **Simplicity**: Minimize complexity, maximize clarity

## Exploration Areas

*(Ideas that need more research before becoming recommendations)*

### Idea 1: [Title]

**Context:**
[What problem space this addresses]

**Open Questions:**
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] [Research or experimentation needed]
