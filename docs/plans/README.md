# Improvement Plans

This directory contains strategic improvement plans for the Graft documentation and knowledge base.

## Active Plans

### Meta-Knowledge-Base Compliance Improvements

**Plan:** [meta-kb-compliance-improvements.md](meta-kb-compliance-improvements.md)
**Created:** 2026-01-05
**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Priority:** High (before feature branch merge)

**Summary:** Systematic plan to improve Graft documentation's alignment with meta-knowledge-base best practices from ~80% to 95%+ compliance.

**Key improvements:**
- Add lifecycle markers to all documentation
- Add provenance sections to ground claims in specs and code
- Clarify authority boundaries between graft and graft-knowledge
- Establish status document lifecycle and archival
- Fix linking policy issues
- Optional: Add code-level provenance for enhanced maintainability

**Supporting analysis:** [notes/2026-01-05-meta-knowledge-base-compliance-analysis.md](../../notes/2026-01-05-meta-knowledge-base-compliance-analysis.md)

**Implementation approach:**
- 6 phases from immediate quick wins to optional enhancements
- Each phase has clear success criteria and verification steps
- Total estimated time: 12-16 hours (excluding optional Phase 6)
- Recommended order: Phase 5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 6

**For agents:** This plan is structured for systematic implementation. Read each phase carefully, follow templates exactly, and verify success criteria before proceeding.
