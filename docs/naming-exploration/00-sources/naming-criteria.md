# Naming Criteria and Constraints

## User Preferences

Based on our discussion, the ideal name should:

### Tone: Consider Different Approaches
We want to explore multiple tonal directions:
- **Technical/Engineering** - Names that clearly signal this is a developer tool
- **Abstract/Poetic** - Names that are memorable and have broader appeal
- **Descriptive/Clear** - Names where the function is immediately obvious
- **Playful/Creative** - Names using creative metaphors that make the tool approachable

We'll generate candidates across all these categories and evaluate.

### Emphasis: Balanced Mix
The name should capture multiple aspects without overemphasizing one:
- Git/version control foundations
- AI/synthesis capabilities
- Pipeline/flow orchestration
- Content workflow management

Avoid names that only capture one dimension (e.g., "gitdocs" overemphasizes git, "llmdocs" overemphasizes AI).

### Hard Constraints
- **Pronounceable** - Must be easy to say aloud, not acronym soup
- **Short (≤8 characters)** - Easy to type, memorable like 'git', 'dvc', 'npm'

### Soft Preferences
- Single word preferred (but compound words like "gitflow" are acceptable if better)
- Domain availability is a plus but not required initially

## Evaluation Rubric

For each candidate name, we'll evaluate:

1. **Memorability** (1-5): How easily does it stick in your mind?
2. **Pronounceability** (1-5): How easy is it to say aloud?
3. **Distinctiveness** (1-5): How unique is it in the tool/docs space?
4. **Evocativeness** (1-5): Does it evoke the right mental model?
5. **Brevity** (1-5): Is it short and easy to type? (8 chars = 5, longer = lower)
6. **Clarity** (1-5): Do you have a sense of what it does from the name?
7. **Professional** (1-5): Does it feel credible for enterprise use?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Overused suffixes**: -flow, -docs, -hub, -sync (unless truly exceptional)
- **Generic tech terms**: pipe, stream, build, gen (too broad)
- **Awkward compounds**: gitaiflow, docpipe, llmflow (hard to say)
- **Existing names**: docflow (taken), gitbook (taken), mkdocs (taken)
- **Obscure acronyms**: GDPC, LLMDG, CVCS (unmemorable, hard to say)
- **Too abstract**: quantum, nexus, paradigm (doesn't evoke anything specific)

## Inspiration Sources

We can draw inspiration from:

1. **Successful tool names**: git (short, memorable), dvc (acronym but pronounceable), flux (evocative)
2. **Natural processes**: confluence, synthesis, weaving, forging
3. **Publishing/writing metaphors**: scribe, quill, manuscript, codex
4. **Flow/water metaphors**: eddy, rivulet, tributary, delta
5. **Botanical metaphors**: rootstock, graft, vine, arbor
6. **Architectural metaphors**: keystone, lintel, vault, lattice
7. **Musical metaphors**: cadence, tempo, motif, chord

## Context: Why We're Renaming

The current name "docflow" was:
- A placeholder from ChatGPT
- Already taken by existing projects
- Too generic (many things flow documents)
- Doesn't capture the unique git+AI+pipeline synthesis

We want a name that:
- Reflects the sophistication and uniqueness of the approach
- Will serve well as the tool evolves beyond just markdown docs
- Has room for the project to grow into (git-backed content workflows broadly)

## Success Criteria

The final name should:
1. Score highly across all rubric dimensions (average ≥4.0)
2. Feel right - you know it when you see it
3. Not require extensive explanation to developers
4. Age well - still feel relevant in 5 years
5. Support the vision of git-backed content workflows beyond docs
