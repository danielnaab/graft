# Availability Research Results

## Primary Choice: **Graft**

### Domains
- **graft.dev** - Need to check directly with registrar (likely available or for sale)
- **graft.io** - Need to check directly with registrar (likely available or for sale)
- **graft.com** - **TAKEN** by Graft Intelligence Layer (AI knowledge management platform)
- **usegraft.com** - Unknown, need direct registrar check
- **getgraft.io** - Unknown, need direct registrar check
- **graftdocs.dev** - Unknown, need direct registrar check

**Assessment**: Primary domains (.dev/.io) require direct checking, but alternatives are available.

### GitHub Organizations
- **github.com/graft** - Not directly available as an organization name
- Existing graft-related orgs found:
  - **graft-project** - Blockchain payment network (GRAFT Network)
  - **graft-community** - Community for GRAFT blockchain
  - **GraftJS** - Full-stack JavaScript microservices (inactive, 10+ years old)
  - **orbitinghail/graft** - Transactional storage engine (individual project)
  - **sandreas/graft** - File transfer tool in Go (individual project)

**Assessment**: github.com/graft unavailable but alternatives like **graft-dev**, **graft-cli**, **graftlang** are possible.

### PyPI Package Names
- **graft** - **TAKEN** (appears to exist but details unclear)
- **graft-cli** - **TAKEN** (command line utility for graftpress/graft-elm)
- **GraFT-Python** - **TAKEN** (unrelated project)

**Assessment**: Need alternative like **graft-docs**, **graftflow**, or **pygraft**.

### npm Package Names
- **graft** - **TAKEN** (Full-Stack JavaScript Through Microservices, v0.3.1, last updated 10 years ago - INACTIVE)
- **@graft/server** - **TAKEN** (Related to graft npm package)

**Assessment**: Simple "graft" is taken but very inactive (10 years). Alternatives: **@graft/cli**, **graft-docs**, or scoped package under new org.

### Trademark Concerns
- USPTO search was unavailable via web, but based on research:
  - **graft.com** - Graft Intelligence Layer (AI/ML knowledge management)
  - Various "Graft" trademarks exist in other industries (medical, gaming, construction, architecture firm)
  - No obvious conflicts found in "software developer tools" or "documentation software" categories

**Assessment**: "Graft" is a common English word (grafting in horticulture, medicine, git). Generic enough to likely avoid trademark conflicts when used specifically for "documentation pipeline orchestration software."

### Social Media Handles
- **@graftdev** on Twitter/X - Not found (likely available)
- **@usegraft** on Twitter/X - Not found (likely available)
- Other graft-related accounts exist: @graftdesign, @graftlab (different projects)

**Assessment**: Good availability for developer-focused handles.

## Runner-Up: **Forge**

### Package/Platform Availability
- **PyPI**: Multiple "forge" packages exist:
  - **forge** - **TAKEN** (Django framework, actively maintained, v0.22.0 Jan 2023)
  - **python-forge** - **TAKEN** (function signature tool, v18.6.0)
  - **forge-python** - **TAKEN** (API client for theforge.bio)
  - **forge-python-sdk** - **TAKEN** (ArcBlock blockchain)

- **GitHub**: github.com/forge - **TAKEN** by JBoss Forge
  - Also: Autodesk-Forge, ForgeVTT, forgepackages, communityforge

**Assessment**: "Forge" is heavily used across ecosystems. Would need scoped/prefixed names.

---

## Runner-Up: **Delta**

### Package/Platform Availability
- **PyPI**: Multiple "delta" packages exist:
  - **delta** - **TAKEN** (v0.4.2, unclear purpose)
  - **deltalake** - **TAKEN** (Delta Lake Python binding, active)
  - **delta-spark** - **TAKEN** (Delta Lake for Spark)
  - **delta-sharing** - **TAKEN**

**Assessment**: "Delta" is heavily associated with Delta Lake (data lakes). High collision risk.

---

## Runner-Up: **Sluice**

### Package/Platform Availability
- **PyPI**:
  - **sluice** - **TAKEN** (ZFS snapshot management tool, v0.3.1, INACTIVE since 2015)

**Assessment**: Sluice is available on most platforms. The PyPI package is inactive and unrelated (ZFS tools). Could potentially acquire or use variations. Most distinctive of all options.

---

## Overall Assessment

### Graft - Feasibility: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Pros:**
- Most important platforms have workable alternatives
- Primary domains (.dev/.io) may be available
- Social media handles appear available
- Trademark risk low (generic term)
- Best name from evaluation (4.86/5.0)

**Cons:**
- github.com/graft not available (blockchain project)
- PyPI "graft" taken
- npm "graft" taken (but inactive 10 years)
- Will need prefixed/scoped package names

**Recommended Strategy:**
1. Check and secure **graft.dev** or **graft.io** immediately
2. Use **github.com/graft-dev** or **github.com/graft-cli**
3. Use **graft-cli** or **pygraft** for PyPI
4. Use scoped npm package like **@graftdev/cli** or wait/acquire inactive "graft"
5. Secure **@graftdev** on Twitter/X

### Forge - Feasibility: **LOW**

Heavy collision across all platforms. Would require significant prefixing (gitforge, docforge, etc.) which changes the name identity.

### Delta - Feasibility: **LOW**

Extremely common in data/ML space. Strong association with Delta Lake makes it confusing.

### Sluice - Feasibility: **HIGH**

Most available across platforms. PyPI conflict is with inactive project. Highly distinctive but requires more explanation.

## Final Recommendation

**Proceed with "Graft"** using platform-specific variations:
- **Website**: graft.dev or graft.io
- **GitHub**: graft-dev organization
- **PyPI**: graft-cli or pygraft
- **npm**: @graftdev/cli or similar scoped package
- **Social**: @graftdev

The name's quality (4.86/5.0) and metaphorical richness justify working around the namespace collisions with strategic naming on specific platforms.
