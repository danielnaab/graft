# Final Name Recommendation

Based on the comprehensive evaluation, provide a final recommendation for the project name.

## Recommendation Structure

### 1. The Chosen Name
State the recommended name clearly and prominently.

### 2. Why This Name
Explain in 2-3 paragraphs why this name is the best choice:
- How it captures the essence of the project
- Why it scored well across all criteria
- What makes it distinctive and memorable
- How it will serve the project as it evolves

### 3. Runner-Up Alternatives
List 2-3 strong alternative names if the primary choice doesn't resonate with stakeholders.
For each, briefly explain its strengths.

### 4. Practical Considerations
- Domain availability assessment
- Any potential trademark concerns
- Search engine considerations
- International/pronunciation considerations

### 5. Next Steps
Suggested steps for validating the name:
- Domain registration
- Social media handle availability
- GitHub organization name
- Quick trademark search
- Community feedback approach

## Guidelines

- Be confident but not dogmatic
- Acknowledge if the choice was difficult or if multiple names are equally good
- Consider both immediate appeal and long-term fit
- Think about how the name will appear in documentation, CLIs, import statements
- Imagine explaining the name's origin in blog posts, talks, documentation

The final recommendation should be concise (1-2 pages) but thorough enough to justify the choice.
