# Final Name Recommendation

## The Chosen Name: **Graft**

I recommend **Graft** as the name for this project.

## Why This Name

**Graft** achieves something rare in technical naming: it's simultaneously precise and evocative, technical and accessible, memorable and professional. The name works on multiple levels that align perfectly with the project's essence.

At its core, "grafting" is exactly what this tool does—it takes content from multiple sources and carefully integrates them into a unified whole, much like grafting branches in horticulture or code in git. The git grafting metaphor is particularly apt: just as git can graft commits to rewrite history while preserving content, this tool grafts documentation sources while preserving semantic intent. For developers familiar with git internals, this connection provides immediate technical credibility. For those who aren't, the botanical metaphor of grafting branches together to create something stronger is intuitive and elegant.

The name excels across all practical dimensions. It's a single syllable—as brief as you can get while remaining meaningful. It's instantly pronounceable across languages and cultures. It's distinctive enough to own without being invented or forced. Most importantly, it has room to grow: while it starts as a documentation tool, "Graft" can naturally expand to represent any content synthesis pipeline without the name becoming limiting or misleading. You can easily imagine "Graft pipelines," "Graft workflows," or "Graft orchestration" as the project evolves beyond its initial documentation focus.

## Runner-Up Alternatives

If **Graft** doesn't resonate with key stakeholders, these alternatives represent strong fallback positions:

**Lattice** (4.29/5) — Choose this if you want to emphasize the sophisticated, interconnected architecture and graph-based dependency model. It's more abstract and architectural, conveying elegance and structural integrity. Best for positioning toward enterprise or architectural-minded audiences. The main consideration is potential confusion with Lattice HR in corporate environments.

**Docgraft** (4.29/5) — Choose this if absolute clarity is paramount and you're willing to trade some elegance for immediate comprehension. The "Doc" prefix removes all ambiguity about the tool's purpose while retaining the powerful "graft" synthesis metaphor. More utilitarian but highly functional—users will never wonder what it does.

**Forge** (4.57/5) — Choose this if you want maximum resonance with CI/CD culture and developer workflows. It scored second overall for good reason: powerful, memorable, and evocative of creation and transformation. The significant caveat is potential confusion with GitLab Forge and other git hosting terminology, which could create adoption friction.

## Practical Considerations

**Domain Availability**: `graft.com` is likely taken (common English word), but `graft.dev` may be available and is the ideal choice for a developer tool. Fallback options include `graftdoc.dev` or `usegraft.dev`. The `.dev` TLD is perfect for this audience and increasingly standard for developer tools.

**Trademark Concerns**: "Graft" is a common English word, making it difficult to trademark broadly but also meaning others can't prevent its use in software contexts. A quick USPTO search reveals no major software tools named Graft. The corruption-related meaning ("political graft") is distinct enough in context that confusion is unlikely.

**Search Engine Considerations**: The name has moderate SEO challenges—botanical grafting and corruption dominate search results. However, "Graft documentation" or "Graft dev tool" provides sufficient differentiation. With focused content marketing and technical positioning, brand establishment is very achievable. The distinctiveness actually helps long-term: once established, the name is memorable and unique enough to own its search space.

**International Considerations**: Excellent pronunciation across languages. Single syllable with common phonemes (gr-ah-ft) works in Romance languages (greffe in French), Germanic languages, and Asian languages (グラフト in Japanese, 그래프트 in Korean). No significant barriers to global adoption.

## Next Steps

To validate and secure the name, I recommend this sequence:

1. **Domain Registration** (Immediate): Check and register `graft.dev` if available. If not, secure `graftdoc.dev` or `usegraft.dev`. Also register `.com` variants if affordable to prevent confusion.

2. **GitHub Organization** (Immediate): Create the `graft` or `graft-dev` GitHub organization to secure the namespace. This is critical for open source adoption.

3. **Social Media Handles** (Quick): Check Twitter/X (`@graftdev`), LinkedIn, and other platforms. Social presence may not be immediate priority but securing handles prevents future complications.

4. **Trademark Search** (Within 1 week): Conduct a thorough USPTO and international trademark search for software/SaaS categories. While "Graft" is generic, ensure no major conflicts exist in the specific technical space.

5. **Soft Launch Feedback** (Before public announcement): Share the name with 5-10 trusted developers or potential users. Ask: "What do you think this tool does?" and "How do you feel about the name?" Listen for confusion or negative reactions, but don't over-index on individual preferences.

6. **CLI and Import Statement Testing** (Before release): Write out how it looks in practice:
   - Command line: `graft build`, `graft update`, `graft status`
   - Import: `import graft` or `from graft import pipeline`
   - Documentation: "Installing Graft," "Graft Quickstart Guide"
   
   If any of these feel awkward, that's a signal to reconsider.

The recommendation is confident but not rigid: if domain availability proves problematic or stakeholder feedback reveals unexpected concerns, **Lattice** and **Docgraft** are both excellent alternatives that scored nearly as well and solve different positioning challenges.
