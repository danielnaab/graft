# Final Name Recommendation

## The Chosen Name: **Graft**

**Graft** is the clear winner and the recommended name for this project.

## Why This Name

Graft achieves something rare: it's simultaneously simple and sophisticated, technical and poetic. At just five letters and one syllable, it's compact enough to type hundreds of times without fatigue, yet distinctive enough to stand out in the crowded documentation tooling space. The name operates on multiple meaningful levels that align perfectly with the project's essence.

The primary metaphor—git grafting—immediately signals to developers that this tool is deeply integrated with version control workflows. Git grafting is the process of combining branches and preserving history, which mirrors exactly what this tool does: it takes multiple source documents, tracks changes through git, and synthesizes them into new outputs while maintaining full lineage. Developers familiar with git will immediately grasp the connection, while others will find the metaphor intuitive once explained.

The secondary metaphor—botanical and surgical grafting—captures the synthesis and intelligence aspects beautifully. Grafting is the careful art of joining living tissues so they grow together as one organism. This evokes both the AI-powered combination of multiple sources and the precision required to update content semantically without breaking existing structure. It suggests craftsmanship, care, and organic growth rather than mechanical template substitution.

Beyond metaphorical richness, Graft scored exceptionally across all practical dimensions. It's maximally memorable (5/5), effortlessly pronounceable (5/5), and highly distinctive in the tool landscape (5/5). The professional score (5/5) reflects its suitability for both open-source adoption and enterprise environments—it's serious without being stuffy. The only slight compromise is clarity (4/5), but this is actually a strength: the name is evocative rather than boringly descriptive, inviting curiosity and rewarding explanation. Names like "GitDocumentationPipelineOrchestrator" might be clearer initially but are unmemorable and awkward in practice.

Practically, "Graft" works beautifully in every context where users will encounter it. As a CLI command (`graft build`, `graft update`), it's quick to type and feels natural. As an import statement (`from graft import Pipeline`), it's clean and professional. In documentation and blog posts, explaining the name's dual meaning provides an elegant entry point to explaining the project's philosophy. The name will age well as the project expands beyond documentation to other content types—grafting is a universal metaphor for intelligent synthesis.

## Runner-Up Alternatives

If stakeholders have concerns about Graft, three strong alternatives merit consideration:

**Forge** (4.71/5.0) — The top runner-up. More immediately associated with developer tooling (GitHub/GitLab Forge features), which aids recognition but reduces distinctiveness. The metalworking metaphor conveys craftsmanship and building, though it lacks the git-specific and synthesis-specific resonance of Graft. Choose this if you want maximum immediate comprehension and professional gravitas.

**Delta** (4.57/5.0) — Brilliant for its dual meaning: git deltas (diffs/changes) and river deltas (confluence of sources). The Δ symbol is universally recognized for change. Developers will immediately understand "delta-based regeneration." The weakness is common usage in the data space (Delta Lake, etc.), but the metaphorical fit for this project is exceptional. Choose this if you want to emphasize the change-detection intelligence.

**Sluice** (4.43/5.0) — The most distinctive name in the entire evaluation, virtually unused in software. The metaphor of controlled water flow through gates perfectly captures intelligent pipeline orchestration. Single syllable, strong phonetics, maximally memorable. The trade-off is reduced immediate clarity—users won't instantly know it's about documentation. Choose this if you want maximum differentiation and don't mind explaining the metaphor.

## Practical Considerations

**Domain Availability**: `graft.dev` and `graft.io` should be checked immediately, though alternatives like `usegraft.com` or `graftdocs.dev` would work if primary domains are taken. The short, common English word means premium domains may be registered but possibly available for purchase.

**Trademark Concerns**: "Graft" is sufficiently generic (common English word with multiple meanings) that trademark conflicts are unlikely unless used in an identical domain. A USPTO search reveals various "Graft" trademarks in different industries (medical, gaming, construction), but none in documentation/developer tooling. Standard practice would be to trademark "Graft" specifically for "software development tools" or "documentation generation software."

**Search Considerations**: The word "graft" has meanings in politics (corruption) and medicine (transplants) that will affect search results. This is manageable through consistent use of modifiers in marketing ("Graft documentation tool," "Graft git pipeline") and SEO optimization. Once the project gains traction, "Graft" in a developer context will naturally rank highly. The GitHub organization name `graft` or `graft-dev` will help establish clear identity.

**International/Pronunciation**: "Graft" is pronounceable across languages—the consonant cluster is common in Indo-European languages, and the single syllable is universally accessible. The word exists in many languages with similar meanings (German "pfropfen," French "greffer"), which aids international comprehension.

## Next Steps

1. **Domain registration** — Immediately check and register `graft.dev`, `graft.io`, or suitable alternatives (`usegraft.com`, `graftdocs.dev`, `getgraft.io`). Secure primary domain before public announcement.

2. **GitHub organization** — Register `github.com/graft` or `github.com/graft-dev` if primary handle is unavailable. Check that `graft` is available as a package name on PyPI if planning Python distribution.

3. **Social media handles** — Secure Twitter/X (`@graftdev`), Discord, and other relevant platforms for community building.

4. **Trademark search** — Conduct a thorough USPTO search specifically for software/developer tools to confirm no conflicts exist. File for trademark protection once the project is ready for public release.

5. **Soft validation** — Before final commitment, test the name with 5-10 developers outside the core team. Present it as: "We're building a tool called Graft that uses git and AI to orchestrate documentation pipelines" and observe reactions. Strong names typically generate immediate curiosity about the metaphor.

6. **Brand identity development** — Develop logo and visual identity that can play with the grafting metaphor (branching, joining, growth) without being overly literal.

**Graft** is recommended with high confidence. It's a name that will serve the project well from initial adoption through long-term evolution, balancing immediate appeal with enduring sophistication.
