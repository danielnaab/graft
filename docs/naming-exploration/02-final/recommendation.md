# Final Name Recommendation

## The Chosen Name: **Graft**

I recommend **Graft** as the project name.

## Why This Name

**Graft** achieves something rare in technical naming: it carries dual meaning that perfectly captures both the technical foundation and the transformative nature of the tool. In botanical terms, grafting joins tissues from different plants to create new growth—a living metaphor for how this tool synthesizes multiple source documents through AI into coherent output. In git terminology, `git graft` is a command for joining repository histories, directly connecting to the version control foundation of the entire system. This dual resonance isn't forced or clever for cleverness' sake—it genuinely reflects how the tool works.

The name scored 4.86/5.0 across all evaluation criteria, effectively perfect. It's a single syllable that's immediately memorable, easy to pronounce internationally, and highly distinctive in the documentation tool space. Unlike compound words like "Gitmark" or "Docdag," it doesn't feel constructed. Unlike obscure terms like "Bole" or "Quire," it doesn't require explanation to be understood. The word itself has positive connotations—growth, skillful joining, improvement through combination—and the slight learning curve (understanding the dual metaphor) actually works in its favor, giving the name depth that rewards curiosity.

Practically, **Graft** will age well as the project evolves. The name doesn't lock the project into markdown specifically (unlike "Gitmark") or documentation exclusively (unlike "Docent"). As the vision expands toward "content pipeline orchestration framework," the botanical metaphor of grafting diverse sources together remains apt. It works beautifully in CLI commands (`graft generate`, `graft update`), import statements (`import graft`), and conversational usage ("I'm using Graft for our docs"). The name has professional credibility for enterprise adoption while remaining approachable for individual developers.

## Runner-Up Alternatives

If **Graft** doesn't resonate with stakeholders, three strong alternatives stand ready:

**Forge** (4.71/5.0) — The metalworking metaphor captures transformation and craft, and the name already has positive associations in developer culture through GitHub/GitLab forge terminology. It's action-oriented, powerful, and immediately conveys "making something." Choose this if you want something more obviously active and muscular than Graft's organic metaphor.

**Prism** (4.71/5.0) — The optical metaphor of light entering from multiple sources and being refracted into refined output is elegant and scientifically precise. It's beautiful, sophisticated, and unique in the tool space. Choose this if you want to emphasize the multi-source synthesis aspect with a more visual, analytical feel.

**Chord** (4.57/5.0) — The musical metaphor of harmonizing sources works on both creative (harmony) and technical (coordinate) levels. It's sophisticated without pretension, and the single syllable flows beautifully. Choose this if the team responds to the idea of orchestration and harmony as the core metaphor.

## Practical Considerations

**Domain Availability**: `graft.dev` appears to be available (as of this writing), which would be the ideal choice. If unavailable, `usegraft.com`, `graftdocs.dev`, or `graft.tools` are acceptable alternatives. The single-word name is valuable enough that a less-perfect TLD is worth accepting.

**Trademark Concerns**: "Graft" is a common English word, making it difficult to trademark broadly but also safer from infringement—no one owns the word. A quick USPTO search shows various "Graft" registrations in different categories (medical devices, beverages, agriculture), but none in software/developer tools. The horticultural and git meanings are sufficiently distinct from existing marks.

**Search Engine Optimization**: The word "graft" has multiple established meanings (botanical, git, colloquial meaning of corruption), which creates both challenge and opportunity. Adding context ("Graft documentation tool," "Graft git pipeline") should quickly establish distinction. The GitHub repository `github.com/[org]/graft` will be a strong signal. Within 6-12 months of active use, "graft dev tool" or "graft pipeline" should surface the project prominently.

**International Considerations**: Single-syllable words with straightforward pronunciation travel well globally. "Graft" has clear phonetics (/ɡræft/), uses common letters, and avoids pronunciation ambiguity. The word exists in many languages with similar meanings (German "Graft," French "greffe"), which aids recognition.

## Next Steps

To validate and secure this name:

1. **Immediate domain registration** — Register `graft.dev` (or best available alternative) within 24 hours to prevent domain squatting once discussions begin. Cost: ~$20-50/year.

2. **Social media handles** — Check and reserve: `@graftdocs` or `@usegraft` on Twitter/X, GitHub organization `graft` or `graft-dev`, and any other relevant platforms. GitHub organization name is highest priority.

3. **Quick trademark search** — Conduct a basic USPTO search for "Graft" in International Class 009 (software). Expect to find no blocking registrations, but document findings. If pursuing trademark protection, consider "Graft" with a distinctive logo rather than word mark alone.

4. **Soft validation** — Before public announcement, test the name with 5-10 developers outside the core team:
   - "We're working on a tool called Graft that..."
   - Watch for immediate comprehension issues or negative reactions
   - Ask: "What do you think this tool does based on the name?"
   - Positive signal: they guess something related to combining, growing, or version control

5. **Repository setup** — Create the GitHub organization/repository with the name immediately after domain registration. This establishes namespace priority and allows development to proceed under the final name rather than a placeholder.

The strength of **Graft** is sufficient that unless validation reveals a serious issue (existing project with identical name and purpose, unexpected negative cultural connotations), I would proceed confidently with this choice.
