# Hybrid/Balanced Name Generation

Generate 15-20 name candidates that balance technical clarity with creative appeal. These should:

**Balance Multiple Aspects**:
- Git/version control + AI/synthesis
- Technical credibility + Creative memorability
- Clear purpose + Abstract appeal
- Developer-friendly + Approachable

**Possible Approaches**:
1. **Portmanteaus**: Blend technical + metaphorical terms
   - Example: "confluence" (flow + merge)
   - Example: "vertex" (technical + apex/top)

2. **Repurposed Technical Terms**: Use terms from other domains
   - Music: cadence, tempo, chord, stanza
   - Architecture: lattice, keystone, vault
   - Math/Graph theory: vertex, edge, delta, graph

3. **Single Evocative Words**: Neither purely technical nor purely poetic
   - Examples: flux, forge, trace, weave, graft

4. **Clever Compounds**: Technical + creative that work together
   - Must sound natural and pronounceable
   - Example pattern: mark + something, git + something, doc + something

For each name candidate, provide:
1. **Name** (≤8 characters preferred)
2. **Balance**: How it combines technical + creative (explain)
3. **Multi-faceted**: Which aspects it captures (git/AI/pipeline/synthesis)
4. **Pronounceability**: How easy it is to say (1-5)
5. **Overall Appeal**: Gut reaction - does it feel right? (1-5)

Focus on names that:
- Feel both technical and creative
- Work for both developers and broader audiences
- Capture multiple aspects without being literal
- Are memorable but professional
- Stand out in the crowded tools landscape

Prioritize names that make you think "that's clever" rather than "that's obvious."
