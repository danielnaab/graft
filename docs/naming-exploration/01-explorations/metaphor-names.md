# Metaphor-Based Name Candidates

## Water & Flow Metaphors

### 1. **Eddy**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A circular current of water, counter to the main stream; suggests controlled circulation and refinement
- **Relevance**: Documents circulate through the pipeline, being refined with each pass; git branches merge and flow like water currents
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Simple, two syllables
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Uncommon in tech tooling, though Eddy Labs exists

### 2. **Delta**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Where river meets ocean, deposits accumulate and transform; mathematical symbol for change
- **Relevance**: Perfect dual meaning - git diffs are deltas, and the tool synthesizes multiple tributaries (sources) into a cohesive output
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Universally known
- **Distinctiveness**: 3/5 - Used in tech (Delta Lake) but not for documentation

### 3. **Rivulet**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A small stream or brook; suggests gentle, continuous flow
- **Relevance**: Content flows from sources through the pipeline in manageable streams
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Three syllables but smooth
- **Distinctiveness**: 5/5 - Rare in tech naming

### 4. **Flume**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: An artificial channel for water, engineered to direct flow
- **Relevance**: Precisely captures the engineered pipeline aspect - directing content flow through controlled stages
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable, clear
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Flume (data tool) exists but different domain

### 5. **Rill**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A small stream; also the channels water carves in soil
- **Relevance**: Git history carves channels through content; small, manageable flows that create lasting patterns
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable
- **Distinctiveness**: 5/5 - Virtually unused in tech

## Botanical Metaphors

### 6. **Graft**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Joining plant tissues to grow as one; combining strengths of different sources
- **Relevance**: AI grafts multiple source documents into synthesized output; git grafts (rare but real git term) combine histories
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Not common in documentation tools

### 7. **Bole**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: The trunk of a tree; the central supporting structure
- **Relevance**: Git is the trunk/foundation; branches emerge and merge; documentation grows from this core
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable
- **Distinctiveness**: 5/5 - Rare in any context

### 8. **Arbor**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A tree or tree-like structure; also a frame supporting growth
- **Relevance**: Documentation DAG is tree-structured; arbor suggests both organic growth and engineered support
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Two syllables, familiar
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Arbor Networks exists but different domain

### 9. **Vine**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A plant that grows by connecting to structures; spreads and interconnects
- **Relevance**: Documentation dependencies vine through the DAG; git history vines through commits
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable
- **Distinctiveness**: 3/5 - Twitter's Vine existed, but now defunct

## Architectural Metaphors

### 10. **Lintel**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: The supporting beam above a doorway; holds weight, enables passage
- **Relevance**: The tool is infrastructure supporting content flow; git is the foundational support
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Two syllables, may be unfamiliar
- **Distinctiveness**: 5/5 - Virtually unused in tech

### 11. **Truss**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Framework of beams forming rigid structure; strength through interconnection
- **Relevance**: Pipeline stages interconnect like truss members; dependencies create structural integrity
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Not common in software tools

### 12. **Lattice**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Interwoven structure forming a pattern; combines strength with openness
- **Relevance**: Documentation DAG is a lattice of dependencies; git history lattices branches and merges
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Two syllables but smooth
- **Distinctiveness**: 3/5 - Lattice (company) exists, but term is distinctive

## Musical Metaphors

### 13. **Cadence**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A rhythmic sequence; the flow and resolution in music or speech
- **Relevance**: Documentation updates follow a cadence; git commits establish rhythm; pipeline orchestrates timing
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Two syllables, familiar word
- **Distinctiveness**: 3/5 - Cadence (company) exists in CI/CD space

### 14. **Motif**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A recurring thematic element; pattern that repeats with variation
- **Relevance**: Documentation patterns repeat across documents; templates are motifs; git commits show motifs of change
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Two syllables, may need pronunciation clarification
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Uncommon in documentation tools

### 15. **Refrain**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A repeated phrase in music; also means to hold back or control
- **Relevance**: Dual meaning perfect - documents refrain (repeat) patterns while the tool refrains from unnecessary regeneration
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Two syllables, familiar
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Not commonly used in tech

## Publishing & Writing Metaphors

### 16. **Codex**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Ancient manuscript in book form (vs scroll); organized knowledge
- **Relevance**: Git is a versioned codex of content; documentation is organized, structured knowledge
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Two syllables, clear
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Used in gaming/culture but not documentation tools

### 17. **Folio**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A sheet of paper folded once; a collection of works; also page number
- **Relevance**: Version control tracks folios (versions); documents collected into cohesive whole
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 - Three syllables but familiar
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 - Not common in dev tools

### 18. **Scribe**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: One who writes/copies documents; medieval knowledge worker
- **Relevance**: AI acts as scribe, synthesizing sources into output; automated documentation creation
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable
- **Distinctiveness**: 3/5 - Scribe (company) exists but term is strong

## Synthesis & Process Metaphors

### 19. **Forge**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: To create by heating and hammering; to form relationships or documents
- **Relevance**: AI forges documents from sources; git forge (GitHub/GitLab); pipeline forges outputs
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable
- **Distinctiveness**: 2/5 - Common in tech (GitLab is "forge"), but powerful

### 20. **Weave**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Interlacing threads to form fabric; combining elements into whole
- **Relevance**: AI weaves multiple sources together; git history weaves branches; perfect synthesis metaphor
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 - Single syllable
- **Distinctiveness**: 3/5 - Weave (company) exists but name is evocative
