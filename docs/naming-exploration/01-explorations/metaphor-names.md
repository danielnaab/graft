- **Distinctiveness**: 5/5 (very uncommon, memorable)

### 7. **Taproot**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: The primary root from which smaller roots branch; goes deep and anchors
- **Relevance**: Git as the taproot anchoring all content; source documents are taproots that branch into synthesis; deep versioning
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (TAP-root, compound but clear)
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 (uncommon in tech, but 7 chars)

### 8. **Arbor**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A tree or lattice framework supporting growth; also means "tree" in Latin
- **Relevance**: Git tree structure; documentation DAG like an arbor supporting content growth; elegant branch metaphor
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (AR-bor, simple two syllables)
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 (recognizable but uncommon in tools)

## Architectural Metaphors

### 9. **Lintel**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Horizontal support spanning an opening; distributes load from above
- **Relevance**: The tool spans between sources and outputs, distributing AI synthesis load; structural integrity of documentation
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (LIN-tel, clear and simple)
- **Distinctiveness**: 5/5 (very uncommon in tech)

### 10. **Lattice**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Interconnected framework with regular gaps; creates structure from simple elements
- **Relevance**: Documentation DAG as lattice; git commits form lattice structure; AI weaves sources through the lattice
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (LAT-iss, simple)
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 (somewhat used in tech but still good)

### 11. **Truss**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Framework of beams supporting structure through triangulated connections
- **Relevance**: DVC+git+AI form a truss supporting documentation; triangulation of sources, prompts, and outputs
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (TRUSS, one syllable)
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 (clear word, uncommon in tools)

## Musical Metaphors

### 12. **Cadence**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Rhythmic flow; sequence of notes/chords ending a phrase; also cycling rhythm in running
- **Relevance**: Git commit cadence; document regeneration cycles; rhythmic flow through the pipeline
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (KAY-dense, smooth)
- **Distinctiveness**: 3/5 (used in some contexts, but still strong)

### 13. **Motif**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Recurring theme or pattern; musical phrase that repeats with variations
- **Relevance**: Source documents as motifs that AI varies and recombines; patterns recurring through documentation layers
- **Pronounceability**: 4/5 (moh-TEEF, clear but two syllables)
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 (uncommon in tools)

### 14. **Refrain**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Repeated section in music; also means "to hold back"
- **Relevance**: Git preserves refrains (unchanged content); MAINTAIN action as refrain; intelligent restraint from unnecessary regeneration
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (rih-FRAYN, clear)
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 (good word, uncommon in tech)

## Writing & Publishing Metaphors

### 15. **Codex**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Ancient manuscript book; transition from scrolls to bound pages
- **Relevance**: Evolution from chaotic docs to structured, version-controlled documentation; codex as code + index
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (KOH-deks, clear)
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 (used occasionally but still distinctive)

### 16. **Folio**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: A leaf of paper/manuscript; also a numbered page; collection of related works
- **Relevance**: Git commits as folios; documentation leaves building into volumes; portfolio of synthesized content
- **Pronounceability**: 5/5 (FOH-lee-oh, smooth)
- **Distinctiveness**: 4/5 (uncommon in tech tools)

### 17. **Quire**
- **Etymology/Metaphor**: Four sheets of paper folded to form eight leaves; building block of medieval books
- **Relevance**: Source documents as quires assembled into complete volumes; modular documentation building blocks
