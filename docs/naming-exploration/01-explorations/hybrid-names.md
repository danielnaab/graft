## Top Recommendations

Based on balance of technical + creative, multi-faceted coverage, and overall appeal:

**Tier 1 (Strongly Recommended):**
1. **Graft** - Perfect balance of git metaphor + synthesis, memorable, professional
2. **Forge** - Powerful, technical credibility, slight concern about git forge association
3. **Lattice** - Elegant structure metaphor, captures DAG/graph/weaving beautifully

**Tier 2 (Strong Contenders):**
4. **Gitweave** - Clear but clever, good technical + creative balance
5. **Trace** - Clean technical term with flow metaphor
6. **Delta** - Strong git association, familiar to developers
7. **Cadence** - Professional, captures orchestration rhythm

**Graft** edges ahead as the top choice: it's short (5 chars), memorable, technically precise (git grafting), evokes synthesis, and feels both professional and creative.
