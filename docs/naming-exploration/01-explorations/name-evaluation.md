## Top 10 Finalists

### 1. **Graft** (4.71/5)
**Rationale**: This is the strongest candidate across nearly all dimensions. It's a single-syllable word that's easy to remember and say, yet carries deep technical meaning. The git grafting metaphor is precise and professional, while the botanical/surgical connotations suggest careful synthesis and integration. It scores maximum points on pronounceability and brevity (5 characters), and the professional credibility is exceptional. The only minor weakness is that "grafting" might not be immediately obvious to non-git users, but this actually creates intrigue rather than confusion.

### 2. **Forge** (4.57/5)
**Rationale**: Powerful, memorable, and deeply evocative of both creation and CI/CD pipelines. The single syllable makes it incredibly easy to use in conversation ("let's forge that doc"). It resonates with developer culture (artifact forging, build systems) while remaining accessible. The main consideration is the association with GitLab Forge and GitHub's terminology, which could be either a feature (familiar) or a bug (confusion). Strong professional credibility.

### 3. **Lattice** (4.29/5)
**Rationale**: Elegant and sophisticated, this name beautifully captures the interconnected DAG structure and woven nature of multi-source synthesis. It's memorable without being gimmicky, and has strong technical credibility (lattice structures in CS, network topologies). The 7-character length is still reasonable. Slightly lower on clarity for newcomers, but the sophisticated image it projects is valuable for enterprise positioning.

### 4. **Trace** (4.29/5)
**Rationale**: Clean, understated technical excellence. "Trace" immediately suggests version tracking, dependency following, and content lineage—all core to the tool's value. Single syllable, maximum brevity, highly professional. The downside is it might be *too* understated and could get lost in the crowded monitoring/observability tool space where "trace" is common terminology.

### 5. **Delta** (4.14/5)
**Rationale**: Strong technical resonance with git (delta compression, diffs) and familiar to developers. The mathematical/scientific connotation adds credibility. However, it's extremely common in tech naming (Delta Lake, various diff tools), which reduces distinctiveness significantly. Still, the clarity and professional polish are undeniable.

### 6. **Gitweave** (4.29/5)
**Rationale**: This portmanteau excels at clarity—you immediately understand it's about git and synthesis. The compound nature makes it slightly longer (8 chars, right at the boundary), but it flows naturally. Strong evocativeness and distinctiveness. The main weakness is it might feel slightly obvious or on-the-nose, lacking the subtlety of top candidates.

### 7. **Docgraft** (4.29/5)
**Rationale**: Similar strengths to Gitweave—excellent clarity with the "doc" prefix immediately signaling documentation. The "graft" component adds the synthesis metaphor. Very practical and functional. The trade-off is it's more descriptive than evocative, potentially limiting its memorability compared to single-word options.

### 8. **Cadence** (4.00/5)
**Rationale**: Professional and polished, suggesting rhythm, flow, and regular orchestration. Works well in enterprise contexts ("our documentation cadence"). The musical/temporal metaphor is accessible. However, it's less directly connected to git or synthesis concepts, requiring more explanation. Also somewhat common in business vocabulary.

### 9. **Keystone** (4.00/5)
**Rationale**: Strong architectural metaphor suggesting foundational importance and structural integrity. Professional and memorable. The 8-character length pushes brevity limits, and while it suggests centrality, it doesn't immediately evoke documentation pipelines or version control. Solid but not exceptional on evocativeness.

### 10. **Verge** (4.00/5)
**Rationale**: Intriguing single-syllable option suggesting convergence, edges, and transformation points. Abstract enough to be interesting, concrete enough to ground the concept. The synthesis/convergence metaphor works well. However, clarity suffers—it's not immediately obvious what it does. Could be memorable precisely because it requires explanation.

## Notable Mentions

### **Vertex** (3.71/5)
Strong graph theory connection and common in technical vocabulary, but perhaps *too* common. Loses distinctiveness in a sea of graph databases and network tools. Would work but doesn't stand out.

### **Chord** (3.71/5)
Pleasant musical metaphor for harmony and connection, but the relationship to documentation pipelines feels tenuous. More evocative than functional. Could work for a collaboration tool but undersells the technical sophistication here.

### **Weavelit** (3.29/5)
Creative portmanteau with nice dual meaning (weave + lit/lightweight), but perhaps too clever. The "lit" suffix might date poorly or read as trying too hard. Interesting but not finalist-worthy.

## Eliminated Names

**Common patterns in low-scoring names:**

- **Overly abstract/literary** (Stanza, Motif, Quill): These scored poorly on clarity and evocativeness. They're pleasant words but don't ground the technical function. Users want some hint of what the tool does.

- **Too descriptive** (Markgraph): While clear, purely descriptive names lack memorability and professional polish. They feel utilitarian rather than crafted.

- **Obscure references** (Lintel): Architectural terms that aren't commonly known create barriers to entry without adding sufficient distinctiveness value.

- **Invented terms** (Graftic): Novel constructions often feel forced and lack the credibility of established words with rich connotations.

- **Diminutive feeling** (Eddy): Names suggesting small-scale or lightweight operations undersell the industrial-strength pipeline capabilities.

## Deep Analysis: Top 5 Candidates

### 1. **Graft**

**Domain Availability**: 
- graft.com: Likely taken (common word)
- graft.dev: Possibly available, .dev is less saturated
- graftdoc.dev: Likely available fallback

**Search Engine Friendliness**: 
Moderate challenge—"graft" has botanical and corruption-related meanings that dominate search. However, "Graft documentation" or "Graft AI docs" would differentiate well. Brand establishment required but achievable.

**Potential Confusion**: 
Minimal in tech space. No major tools named Graft. The word's existing meanings (botanical grafting, git grafting) actually reinforce rather than confuse.

**International Pronunciation**: 
Excellent. Single syllable, common phonemes, no special characters. Easily pronounced in Romance languages, Germanic languages, Asian languages (グラフト). Minor: might be confused with "graph" in some accents, but distinct enough.

---

### 2. **Forge**

**Domain Availability**:
- forge.com: Definitely taken
- forge.dev: Likely taken (popular namespace)
- docforge.dev: Possibly available

**Search Engine Friendliness**: 
Challenging—"forge" is saturated with gaming references, GitLab Forge, Minecraft Forge, etc. Would require strong SEO and brand building. "Forge pipeline" or "Forge docs" might help differentiate.

**Potential Confusion**: 
**Significant concern**: GitLab Forge and general "forge" terminology in git hosting. Users might assume it's related to or requires GitLab. This is the biggest risk for this otherwise excellent name.

**International Pronunciation**: 
Very good. The "or" sound varies across languages but generally manageable. French speakers already know "forge," Germanic languages handle it well. Some Asian languages might render as フォージ but still recognizable.

---

### 3. **Lattice**

**Domain Availability**:
- lattice.com: Definitely taken (HR software company)
- lattice.dev: Likely taken
- doclattice.dev: Probably available

**Search Engine Friendliness**: 
Moderate challenge—Lattice HR dominates, plus materials science and mathematics uses. However, "Lattice documentation" or "Lattice AI" would carve a distinct niche. The uniqueness helps long-term.

**Potential Confusion**: 
Potential confusion with Lattice HR platform in enterprise settings. This could be a dealbreaker for adoption in companies already using Lattice for HR. Requires consideration.

**International Pronunciation**: 
Good. Two syllables, common sounds. "Lat-iss" is fairly universal. French (lattice), Spanish (retícula as translation but word recognizable), Asian languages handle it (ラティス). Minor complexity but manageable.

---

### 4. **Trace**

**Domain Availability**:
- trace.com: Definitely taken
- trace.dev: Likely taken (observability space)
- doctrace.dev: Possibly available

**Search Engine Friendliness**: 
**Very challenging**—"trace" is heavily saturated in observability, debugging, tracing tools (Jaeger, distributed tracing, etc.). Would be difficult to establish distinct brand identity. Requires exceptional SEO and clear positioning.

**Potential Confusion**: 
**High risk**—Users might assume it's another tracing/observability tool. The name doesn't differentiate from the crowded monitoring space. This is a significant drawback despite technical appropriateness.

**International Pronunciation**: 
Excellent. Single syllable, universally understood concept (tracer, tracing). Romance languages handle it perfectly, Asian languages adapt it easily (トレース). No concerns.

---

### 5. **Delta**

**Domain Availability**:
- delta.com: Taken (airline)
- delta.dev: Very likely taken
- docsdelta.dev: Possibly available

**Search Engine Friendliness**: 
**Extremely challenging**—Delta Airlines dominates, plus Delta dental, Delta Lake (data), delta mathematics, COVID delta variant, etc. Establishing brand identity would be very difficult without significant resources.

**Potential Confusion**: 
**Moderate to high**—Users familiar with Delta Lake or git deltas might have preconceptions. The airline association is strong in consumer consciousness. While appropriate technically, the namespace is too crowded.

**International Pronunciation**: 
Excellent. Universal Greek letter, known worldwide in scientific contexts. Perfect across all languages (δelta, デルタ, 델타). Zero concerns.

---

## Final Recommendation

**Top 3 Exceptional Candidates:**

### 🥇 **Graft**
Best overall balance. Distinctive enough to own, technically precise, professionally credible, and internationally accessible. The domain availability is manageable, and search differentiation is achievable with focused positioning. Minor collision concerns are outweighed by strengths.

### 🥈 **Lattice** 
Elegant and sophisticated with strong technical resonance. The Lattice HR confusion is a consideration but affects different buyer personas. Excellent for conveying the interconnected, structural sophistication of the tool. Best choice if targeting enterprise/architectural mindset.

### 🥉 **Docgraft**
If absolute clarity is prioritized over elegance, this compound delivers. Immediately understandable while retaining the powerful "graft" metaphor. More utilitarian but highly functional. Best fallback if "Graft" alone proves problematic in domain/SEO.

**Eliminated from top tier**: Forge (GitLab confusion too risky), Trace (observability namespace too crowded), Delta (impossibly saturated).
