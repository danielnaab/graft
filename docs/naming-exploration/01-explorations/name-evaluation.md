## Top 10 Finalists

### 1. **Graft** (4.86/5.0) 
**Why it wins:** Perfect synthesis of botanical metaphor (grafting plant tissues to create new growth) and git terminology (graft command for joining histories). Single syllable, highly memorable, unique in the tool space. The metaphor captures both the AI synthesis aspect (grafting multiple sources together) and version control foundation (grafting branches). Scores perfectly on brevity, pronounceability, and distinctiveness. Only minor deduction on clarity—the concept requires slight explanation but is quickly grasped.

**Key strengths:** 
- Dual-meaning genius: botanical + git
- One syllable, ultra-memorable
- Evokes organic growth from existing roots
- Professional yet approachable

### 2. **Forge** (4.71/5.0)
**Why it excels:** Powerful action verb that captures the transformation and creation process. Already has positive connotations in developer culture (GitHub/GitLab "forge"). Metalworking metaphor suggests both craft and engineering—raw sources are heated and hammered into refined documentation. Single syllable, strong phonetics, highly professional.

**Key strengths:**
- Action-oriented, suggests transformation
- Familiar in git hosting context
- Strong, memorable phonetics
- Balance of craft and precision

### 3. **Prism** (4.71/5.0)
**Why it excels:** Beautiful metaphor for multi-source synthesis—light entering from multiple angles, refracted through stages, emerging as refined output. Captures the pipeline's transformation nature perfectly. Visually evocative, scientifically precise, professionally credible. Only weakness is clarity—requires explanation of the synthesis metaphor.

**Key strengths:**
- Perfect multi-source transformation metaphor
- Single syllable, elegant
- Scientific precision + visual beauty
- Unique in documentation tool space

### 4. **Chord** (4.57/5.0)
**Why it stands out:** Musical metaphor for harmonizing multiple sources into coherent output. Suggests both synthesis (harmony) and connection (coordinate). Short, memorable, elegant. The musical metaphor is sophisticated without being pretentious—everyone understands harmony. Slight clarity trade-off as it requires connecting the musical metaphor to documentation.

**Key strengths:**
- Harmony metaphor for synthesis
- Musical + mathematical (coordinate)
- Single syllable, flows beautifully
- Sophisticated yet accessible

### 5. **Weave** (4.43/5.0)
**Why it works:** Textile metaphor that perfectly captures AI synthesis—weaving multiple content threads into unified fabric. Git history as interwoven commits, pipeline stages as the loom. Action-oriented verb, single syllable, highly evocative. Clear synthesis metaphor that requires minimal explanation.

**Key strengths:**
- Intuitive weaving metaphor
- Action verb (like forge)
- Git "threads" natural extension
- Craft + complexity balance

### 6. **Trace** (4.43/5.0)
**Why it's strong:** Dual meaning: technical (trace dependencies, trace execution) and creative (drawing/tracing a path). Captures both the reproducibility aspect and the lineage tracking. Simple, professional, high clarity for developers. Works well internationally. Only slight memorability concern—may be too common a word.

**Key strengths:**
- Technical + creative dual meaning
- High clarity for developers
- Suggests lineage and reproducibility
- Clean, professional

### 7. **Flux** (4.29/5.0)
**Why it's compelling:** Continuous change and flow—documents in constant flux through git. Also means "soldering flux" that enables joining, perfect for synthesis. Proven track record (FluxCD). Single syllable, powerful phonetics. Slight distinctiveness concern due to existing usage in tech.

**Key strengths:**
- Dual meaning: change + joining agent
- Proven in other tool contexts
- Scientific precision
- Strong phonetics

### 8. **Gitmark** (4.29/5.0)
**Why it's solid:** Crystal clear compound: git + markdown. Immediately signals what it does. Professional, familiar elements, pronounceable. Highest clarity score (5/5). Main weaknesses: less distinctive (common pattern), slightly longer, less evocative metaphor. But for enterprise adoption, this clarity may be valuable.

**Key strengths:**
- Absolute clarity
- Professional, enterprise-friendly
- Builds on familiar terms
- Zero learning curve for concept

### 9. **Cadence** (4.29/5.0)
**Why it resonates:** Rhythmic flow of commits, regeneration cycles, orchestration. Already familiar in tech (release cadence, Cadence workflow engine). Musical sophistication + software precision. Three syllables but flows naturally. Elegant balance of creative and technical.

**Key strengths:**
- Musical + software release term
- Suggests rhythm and orchestration
- Already familiar in tech contexts
- Professional elegance

### 10. **Codex** (4.29/5.0)
**Why it's interesting:** Ancient manuscript + modern code. Suggests evolution from chaotic docs to structured, version-controlled knowledge. Historical weight + technical precision. Some concerns about gaming associations (Warhammer, Assassin's Creed) and slight overuse, but still strong overall.

**Key strengths:**
- Ancient + modern blend
- Manuscript metaphor for docs
- "Code + index" wordplay
- Cultural sophistication

## Notable Mentions

### **Bole** (4.29/5.0)
Unique botanical term (tree trunk) with perfect git metaphor. Extremely distinctive but suffers from low clarity—most people don't know what "bole" means. Requires explanation, which hurts adoption. Beautiful for those who get it, opaque for those who don't.

### **Quire** (4.29/5.0)
Medieval bookmaking term (four folded sheets). Gorgeous historical metaphor for modular documentation. Very distinctive but obscure—clarity suffers. Pronunciation may confuse (sounds like "choir"?). Niche appeal.

### **Loom** (4.29/5.0)
Weaving device metaphor—the tool that weaves docs. Slightly more concrete than "weave" (noun vs verb). Solid scores across the board but doesn't quite stand out enough to crack top 10. Good fallback option.

### **Docent** (4.14/5.0)
Clever wordplay: museum docent (guide) + document. AI as intelligent guide through documentation. Creative and memorable, but "docent" is 6 letters and the pun may be too subtle. Interesting
