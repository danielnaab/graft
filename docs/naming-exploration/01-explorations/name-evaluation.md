## Top 10 Finalists

### 1. **Graft** (4.86/5.0) 🏆
**Scores**: Mem 5 | Pron 5 | Dist 5 | Evoc 5 | Brev 5 | Clar 4 | Prof 5

**Rationale**: This is the standout winner. At just 5 characters, it's the shortest serious contender. The metaphor is perfect on multiple levels: git grafting (branches), botanical grafting (combining living tissues), and surgical precision. It evokes both the technical foundation (version control) and the synthesis nature (AI combining sources). Highly memorable, distinctive in the tool space, and professional enough for enterprise while remaining approachable. The slight dock in clarity (4/5) is actually a strength—it's evocative rather than boringly descriptive.

### 2. **Forge** (4.71/5.0) 🥈
**Scores**: Mem 5 | Pron 5 | Dist 4 | Evoc 5 | Brev 5 | Prof 5

**Rationale**: Powerful single-syllable name that captures craftsmanship and building. Strong CI/CD connotations in developer tools (GitLab/GitHub Forge features). Scores slightly lower on distinctiveness due to forge-related tooling, but this is offset by immediate recognition and credibility. The metaphor of "forging" documentation from sources is visceral and memorable. Slightly less git-specific than Graft but broader appeal.

### 3. **Gitforge** (4.57/5.0) / **Docgraft** (4.57/5.0) / **Codex** (4.57/5.0) - Three-way tie
**Gitforge** - Clear compound that works if you want maximum clarity. "Git" + "Forge" is self-explanatory, though less poetic.

**Docgraft** - Makes the documentation focus explicit while keeping the grafting metaphor. More descriptive than Graft alone, trades poetry for clarity.

**Codex** - Elegant classical reference (ancient manuscript) with nice double meaning: "code" + "dex" (index). Professional, timeless, suggests organized technical content. Slightly less connected to version control specifically.

### 4. **Delta** (4.57/5.0)
**Scores**: Mem 5 | Pron 5 | Dist 3 | Evoc 5 | Brev 5 | Clar 4 | Prof 5

**Rationale**: Brilliant double meaning—git deltas (changes/diffs) and river deltas (confluence of tributaries). Universally known symbol (Δ) for change. The distinctiveness suffers (3/5) due to common use in tech (Delta Lake, etc.), but the evocativeness for this specific use case is exceptional. Developers immediately understand "delta-based regeneration."

### 5. **Sluice** (4.43/5.0)
**Scores**: Mem 5 | Pron 5 | Dist 5 | Evoc 4 | Brev 5 | Clar 3 | Prof 4

**Rationale**: Most distinctive name in the entire set—virtually unused in software. The metaphor of controlled water flow through gates perfectly captures intelligent pipeline orchestration. Single syllable, strong consonants, memorable. Dock on clarity (not immediately obvious it's about docs) and slight dock on professional feel (less common word may seem informal). But exceptionally unique.

### 6. **Lattice** (4.43/5.0) / **DeltaMD** (4.43/5.0)
**Lattice** - Beautiful structural metaphor for DAG topology. Evokes interconnected dependencies, woven content. Elegant and professional, though less immediately clear it's about documentation.

**DeltaMD** - More explicit technical name. "Delta" for diffs, "MD" for markdown. Professional abbreviation style (like RemarkJS, NextJS). Clear purpose, good for SEO.

### 7. **Diffmark** (4.29/5.0) / **Trace** (4.29/5.0)
**Diffmark** - Git diffs + markdown. Clear, technical, professional. Less poetic but highly descriptive.

**Trace** - Elegant single syllable suggesting both git history tracking and content lineage. Clean and understated, perhaps too subtle.

### 8. **Cadence** (4.14/5.0)
**Scores**: Mem 5 | Pron 5 | Dist 3 | Evoc 4 | Brev 4 | Clar 3 | Prof 5

**Rationale**: Sophisticated and professional. Captures the rhythm of CI/CD pipelines and regeneration cycles. Used in DevOps contexts (release cadence) which helps familiarity but hurts distinctiveness. Doesn't immediately signal "documentation tool" but has gravitas and polish.

### 9. **Gitweave** (4.14/5.0) / **Weave** (4.14/5.0) / **Alloy** (4.14/5.0)
**Gitweave** - Explicit git connection + synthesis metaphor. Clear and memorable compound.

**Weave** - Simple, evocative, captures multi-source synthesis beautifully. Perhaps too generic alone.

**Alloy** - Metallurgical metaphor for combining elements into something stronger. Modern feel, good synthesis metaphor.

### 10. **Bole** (4.00/5.0)
**Scores**: Mem 4 | Pron 5 | Dist 5 | Evoc 3 | Brev 5 | Clar 2 | Prof 4

**Rationale**: Most poetic name on the list. "Bole" (tree trunk) is rare and beautiful, only 4 characters. Git's tree metaphor works perfectly. Major weakness: very unclear what it does without explanation. This is a "grow into" name that rewards those who learn it, but may confuse initially.

## Notable Mentions

**Lintel** (3.86) - Architectural support beam metaphor is apt for pipeline infrastructure. Highly distinctive but obscure—many won't know what a lintel is. Could be compelling for the right audience.

**Scribe** (4.00) - Classic and clear, but doesn't capture the git/pipeline sophistication. Feels more like a simple writing tool.

**Arbor** (4.00) - Tree metaphor works well, but "Arbor Networks" and other uses reduce distinctiveness.

**Truss** (4.00) - Strong engineering metaphor (structural framework), single syllable, but doesn't evoke content/docs specifically.

**Syndoc** (3.86) - "Synthesized docs" is clever and short, but "syn" prefix doesn't immediately parse for everyone.

## Eliminated Names: Common Patterns

**Low-scoring patterns that didn't work:**

1. **Overly compound/long names** (Stagemark, Commitdoc, Markgraph) - Violated the brevity constraint and felt clunky to pronounce.

2. **Too abstract without connection** (Vertex, Strata, Ledger) - Professional but could be any kind of tool. Lack evocativeness for documentation pipelines specifically.

3. **Cute but unclear** (Quill, Chord, Rootlet) - Charming metaphors that don't capture the git+AI+pipeline sophistication.
