# Metaphor-Based Name Generation

Generate 15-20 creative name candidates based on metaphors and natural processes. Consider:

**Natural Processes**: confluence, synthesis, weaving, forging, crystallization, germination
**Publishing/Writing**: scribe, quill, manuscript, codex, scriptorium, folio
**Flow/Water**: eddy, rivulet, tributary, delta, confluence, cascade
**Botanical**: rootstock, graft, vine, arbor, bole, taproot
**Architectural**: keystone, lintel, vault, lattice, truss
**Musical**: cadence, tempo, motif, chord, refrain, stanza

For each name candidate, provide:
1. **Name** (≤8 characters preferred)
2. **Etymology/Metaphor**: What it means and why it's evocative
3. **Relevance**: How it relates to git-backed, AI-powered documentation pipelines
4. **Pronounceability**: How easy it is to say (1-5)
5. **Distinctiveness**: How unique it is in the tools space (1-5)

Focus on names that are:
- Short and memorable
- Easy to pronounce
- Evocative of orchestration, flow, synthesis, or version control
- Not overly literal or technical
- Unique and distinctive

Avoid overused tech suffixes like -flow, -sync, -hub, -docs unless the combination is truly exceptional.
