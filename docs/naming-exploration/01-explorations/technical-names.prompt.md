# Technical/Engineering Name Generation

Generate 15-20 technical name candidates that clearly signal this is a developer tool. Consider:

**Core Technical Concepts**:
- Git operations: commit, merge, branch, rebase, stage, diff
- Pipeline concepts: DAG, stage, flow, pipeline, graph, trace
- Documentation: doc, docs, mark, text, page, content
- Synthesis/Generation: gen, make, build, forge, craft
- Version control: track, version, rev, delta, snapshot

**Possible Patterns**:
- Compounds: gitmark, docdag, markflow, commitdoc
- Portmanteaus: blending two relevant terms cleverly
- Acronyms (if pronounceable): Like DVC, Git, NPM
- Single technical words: vertex, edge, node, graph, delta

For each name candidate, provide:
1. **Name** (≤8 characters preferred)
2. **Technical Meaning**: What technical concepts it references
3. **Clarity**: How clearly it conveys the tool's purpose (1-5)
4. **Pronounceability**: How easy it is to say (1-5)
5. **Professional Appeal**: Does it feel credible for enterprise use? (1-5)

Focus on names that are:
- Short and memorable
- Easy to type and pronounce
- Clear about the domain (docs/content/git)
- Professional and credible
- Unique (not git-flow, doc-sync, etc.)

Avoid:
- Awkward compounds (gitaiflow)
- Unpronounceable acronyms (GDPC, LLMDAG)
- Names already taken (gitbook, mkdocs, docflow)
- Generic terms (build, pipe, stream)
