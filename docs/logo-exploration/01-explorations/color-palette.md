# Graft Logo Color Palette Options

## Palette 1: Rooted Growth

### Color Specifications

- **#2C5F2D** - Forest Anchor - Primary - Deep, saturated green with excellent darkness for professional contexts. Rich forest floor green that suggests established growth and stability.

- **#7A9B76** - Grafted Sage - Secondary - Muted mid-tone green that bridges technical and organic. Neither too bright nor too dull, provides subtle contrast without competing.

- **#1C1C1C** - Carbon Black - Details/Text - Warm-leaning near-black that maintains readability while avoiding harsh pure black.

### Palette Rationale

This palette most directly expresses Graft's core metaphor: botanical grafting meets technical precision. The deep forest green anchors the brand in natural growth processes while maintaining professional gravitas. The sage secondary adds dimension without introducing competing color families. This is the most literal interpretation of "git-native documentation that grows" - earth, roots, and careful cultivation.

**Brand Personality Alignment:**
- Professional yet approachable: Forest green is authoritative without being corporate
- Organic yet engineered: Natural colors with geometric application
- Sophisticated simplicity: Limited palette, maximum impact
- Grounded innovation: Earthy tones suggest solid foundations

**Competitive Differentiation:**
- Warmer and more organic than typical tech blues
- More serious than neon startup greens
- Distinct from Git's orange/red, GitHub's purple
- More botanical than DVC or similar tools
