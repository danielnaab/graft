# Composition and Layout Studies

## 1. Angular Y-Junction with Binding Wrap

### Refined Visual Description

**Core shapes:**
- Two straight paths converging at 55° angle from horizontal
- Single vertical path extending downward from junction
- 2-3 horizontal rectangular bands wrapping the junction point
- All elements use consistent 3-unit stroke weight (at 100-unit scale)

**Proportions:**
- Junction occurs at 40% from top of composition (golden ratio approximation)
- Upper branches: 35 units long each
- Lower trunk: 45 units long
- Branch angle: 55° creates balanced, stable Y-shape
- Wrap bands: 1.5 units tall, spaced 2 units apart, extending 6 units beyond branch width on each side

**Balance:**
- Symmetrical upper branches create stability
- Single trunk creates directionality (top → bottom flow)
- Wrap element provides visual anchor at center of composition
- Weight distributed evenly: 40% top, 30% junction, 30% trunk

**Negative space:**
- Two triangular spaces between branches and trunk
- Rectangular channels between wrap bands
- Surrounding space emphasizes vertical orientation

**Optical adjustments:**
- Branches slightly thickened at junction (3.5 units) for visual strength
- Wrap bands extend beyond branch edges for clear definition
- Vertical trunk perfectly centered for balance

- <rect> at (38, 44), width=24, height=1.5 — wrap band 3

Stroke: 3 units, round caps and joins
Group: <g id="junction-symbol">
```

### Size Variations

**16x16px:**
- Reduce to single wrap band (1px thick)
- Maintain stroke weight at 1.5px minimum
- Simplify to pure Y-shape with single horizontal accent at junction
- Remove outer wrap extension, keep accent within branch width

**32x32px:**
- Two wrap bands visible (1px each)
- 2px stroke weight on branches
- Clear definition of all elements

**48x48px and up:**
- Full detail: three wrap bands
- 3px stroke weight
- All optical adjustments visible
- Wrap bands extend beyond branches for maximum clarity

### Color Application

**Best palette match: Rooted Growth (#2C5F2D, #7A9B76)**
- Branches and trunk: Forest Anchor #2C5F2D
- Wrap bands: Grafted Sage #7A9B76
- Creates clear visual hierarchy: structure in deep green, binding in sage

**Alternative: Technical Synthesis (#2A6B7C, #E07B39)**
- Branches and trunk: Deep Teal #2A6B7C  
- Wrap bands: Terracotta #E07B39
- High contrast emphasizes the grafting junction point

**Monochrome:**
- All elements: Single color (#2C5F2D or #1A1A1A)
- Wrap bands slightly heavier weight (4 units vs 3) for distinction
- Perfect clarity in single color

**Dark mode:**
- Invert to lighter values: #97BC62 for structure, #B8D89D for wraps
- Maintains all relationships and readability

### Lockup Variations

**Icon only:**
- Square composition, 100×100 units
- Works standalone as app icon, favicon, profile image
- Centered in square with 10-unit padding on all sides

**Horizontal lockup:**
- Symbol: 40 units wide, positioned at left
- Spacing: 15 units between symbol and text
- Text: "GRAFT" in sans-serif, x-height aligned with junction point
- Total proportions: Symbol 30%, space 10%, text 60%

**Stacked lockup:**
- Symbol: 60 units wide, top-aligned
- Spacing: 12 units vertical space
- Text: "GRAFT" centered below, 80 units wide
- Proportions: Symbol 50%, space 10%, text 40%

### Refinement Notes

**Strengths:**
- Immediate grafting metaphor recognition — the wrap is iconic
- Extremely scalable — simple geometry holds at all sizes
- The wrap provides distinctive signature element
- Clear directionality for pipeline/flow metaphor
- Balanced and stable composition

**Unique qualities:**
- The wrap binding is unique in logo space — not seen in competitor tools
- Combination of organic metaphor with geometric execution
- Three-dimensionality suggested by wrap without complex rendering

**Potential improvements:**
- Test single diagonal wrap line instead of horizontal bands (may scale better)
- Explore asymmetric branch weights (70% vs 100%) for source variety metaphor
- Consider slight curve to branches for more organic feel while keeping geometry clean

**Technical execution:**
- Very straightforward SVG implementation
- No complex paths or curves
- Wrap bands are simple rectangles
- Could be animated (wrap tightening, branches growing)
- File size: ~800 bytes

## 2. Split-G with Junction Detail

### Refined Visual Description

**Core shapes:**
- Circular letterform G (75-unit diameter circle, 12-unit stroke)
- Diagonal cut at 135° angle through the opening area
- Two offset segments creating visible gap
- Small diamond connector at the diagonal junction
- Horizontal bar extending inward (28 units)

**Proportions:**
- Circle diameter: 75 units (centered in 100×100 viewBox)
- Stroke weight: 12 units (16% of diameter)
- Cut angle: 135° (northwest to southeast)
- Gap width: 4 units of offset between segments
- Diamond connector: 6×6 units, rotated 45°

**Balance:**
- Circular form provides stability
- Diagonal cut creates dynamic asymmetry
- Diamond connector anchors the junction
- Horizontal bar provides visual weight and G-recognition
- Overall: Balanced asymmetry with strong letter recognition

**Negative space:**
- G opening creates primary negative space
- Gap between cut segments creates linear negative space
- Diamond connector interrupts gap, adding complexity
- Interior circular negative space

**Optical adjustments:**
- Top segment slightly heavier at cut edge (13 units vs 12) for stability
- Diamond connector extends 1 unit beyond circle stroke on each side
- Horizontal bar tapered slightly toward end (12 units to 10 units)
- Cut positioned to maintain clear G-legibility

## 3. Tributary Convergence (Simplified)

### Refined Visual Description

**Core shapes:**
- Five curved paths flowing from top perimeter toward bottom center
- Paths have gentle S-curves (single bezier per path)
- Paths merge progressively: 5 → 3 → 1
- Final unified path extends to bottom
- All paths use 2.5-unit stroke weight at 100-unit scale

**Proportions:**
- Starting points distributed across top 70 units (positions at 15, 30, 50, 70, 85)
- Convergence occurs in three stages: 35%, 55%, 75% from top
- Final unified path: 20% of composition height
- Paths taper subtly toward convergence (2.5 to 4 units at merge)

**Balance:**
- Symmetrical distribution of starting points (centered on 50)
- Progressive convergence creates visual rhythm
- Final vertical path provides directional anchor
- Weight increases as paths merge, suggesting accumulation

**Negative space:**
- Organic channel spaces between paths
- Negative spaces narrow as paths converge
- Final path creates strong vertical negative space division

**Optical adjustments:**
- Center path (starting at 50) is slightly heavier (3 units) as visual anchor
- Outer paths curve more dramatically for visual interest
- Merge points show slight overlap for smooth integration
- Final path weight (4 units) balances accumulated visual mass

- Unique among developer tool logos (most are geometric/angular)

**Unique qualities:**
- Flow-based composition rather than static shape
- Multiple-to-one synthesis is visually clear
- Organic yet precise execution
- Can be read as rivers, branches, or data streams

**Potential improvements:**
- Test whether all curves should be identical (mathematical consistency) vs varied (organic variety)

- Consider whether final path should continue straight or curve
- Test with and without subtle background gradient suggesting depth

**Technical execution:**
- Bezier curves require careful construction for smooth appearance
