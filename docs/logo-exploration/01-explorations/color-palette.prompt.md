# Color Palette Development

Develop 3-4 distinct color palette options for the Graft logo, each reflecting different aspects of the brand personality while meeting technical requirements.

For each palette, provide:

## 1. Palette Name
Descriptive name (e.g., "Botanical Tech", "Organic Precision", "Monochrome Elegance")

## 2. Color Specifications
List each color with:
- **Hex code**: Primary digital representation
- **Color name**: Descriptive name
- **Usage**: Primary, secondary, accent, or background
- **Visual swatch description**: What the color looks like

Example:
- **#2C5F2D** - Deep Forest Green - Primary - Rich, earthy green with professional depth
- **#97BC62** - Sage - Secondary - Lighter green for accents and highlights
- **#1A1A1A** - Near Black - Text/details - Almost black for high contrast

## 3. Palette Rationale
Why this palette works for Graft:
- Brand personality alignment
- Metaphor reinforcement
- Visual differentiation from competitors
- Emotional tone and associations

## 4. Theme Variants
How does this palette adapt for different contexts?
- **Light mode version**: Colors optimized for white/light backgrounds
- **Dark mode version**: Colors optimized for dark backgrounds
- **Monochrome fallback**: Single color version
- **Accessibility notes**: Contrast ratios, color-blind considerations

## 5. Application Examples
Describe how this palette would look when applied to:
- Logo symbol/icon
- Text lockup (if applicable)
- Documentation headers
- GitHub README
- Favicon

## 6. Technical Assessment
- Contrast ratios (against white, against black)
- Color-blind simulation results (deuteranopia, protanopia)
- Print/grayscale reproduction quality
- Screen display considerations

## Guidelines

- Maximum 3 colors per palette (including neutrals)
- Must meet WCAG contrast requirements (3:1 minimum for graphics)
- At least one palette should be primarily monochrome
- Consider seasonal/timeless appeal (avoid trendy colors)
- Think about how colors work at different scales (favicon vs. large display)
- Reference color psychology in brand-personality.md

## Recommended Palette Directions

Based on brand personality, explore:

1. **Natural Green + Neutral** - Emphasizes botanical/growth metaphor
2. **Technical Teal/Blue + Accent** - Emphasizes git/tech heritage
3. **Monochrome Elegance** - Timeless, professional, developer-friendly
4. **Earthy Organic** - Warm browns/ochres + green, grounded feel

Each palette should feel distinctly different while maintaining brand alignment.
