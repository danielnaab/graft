# Symbol Concept Exploration

Generate 10-15 distinct logo symbol concepts for Graft based on the visual metaphors identified in the source materials.

For each concept, provide:

## 1. Concept Name
A descriptive name for the symbol concept (e.g., "Grafting Junction", "Converging Branches")

## 2. Visual Description
Detailed description of the symbol's appearance:
- Core geometric forms (circles, rectangles, paths, etc.)
- Composition and layout
- Key visual elements
- Proportions and balance

## 3. Metaphor Connection
Which visual metaphor(s) this concept embodies and how it connects to Graft's brand essence.

## 4. Technical Feasibility
Assessment of how well this concept meets technical requirements:
- Scalability (will it work at 16px?)
- Simplicity (can it be executed cleanly in SVG?)
- Versatility (does it work in monochrome?)

## 5. Initial Scoring (1-5)
Quick evaluation against key criteria:
- **Brand Alignment**: Does it feel like "Graft"?
- **Scalability**: Will it work at all sizes?
- **Memorability**: Is it distinctive and memorable?
- **Simplicity**: Is it appropriately simple?

## Guidelines

- Focus on geometric abstraction over realistic illustration
- Prioritize concepts that work at small sizes
- Explore both pure symbols (no letterforms) and stylized "G" concepts
- Consider how each concept would work with different color palettes
- Aim for diversity - explore multiple metaphor directions
- Include at least 2-3 concepts based on the grafting junction metaphor
- Include at least 2-3 concepts based on letterform "G" variations
- Include at least 2-3 concepts based on branch convergence or synthesis

Organize concepts by metaphor category for easy comparison.
