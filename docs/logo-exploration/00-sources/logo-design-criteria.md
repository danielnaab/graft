# Logo Design Criteria and Evaluation Framework

## Design Goals

The Graft logo should:

1. **Embody the brand essence** - Visually represent grafting, synthesis, and git-based workflows
2. **Work across contexts** - Function at multiple scales (16px favicon to large presentations)
3. **Be memorable and distinctive** - Stand out in a crowded developer tools landscape
4. **Age gracefully** - Remain relevant as the project evolves
5. **Support the name** - Reinforce the "Graft" metaphor without being too literal

## Hard Constraints

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: SVG (scalable vector graphics)
- **Embeddable**: Must work inline in markdown/HTML
- **File size**: < 5KB for performance
- **Accessibility**: Clear at minimum 16x16px (favicon)
- **Monochrome-safe**: Recognizable in single color (for printing, dark mode)

### Usage Contexts
- GitHub README (display at ~200px width)
- CLI tool output (may be ASCII fallback needed)
- Documentation headers
- Social media profiles (square crop)
- Favicon (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
- IDE/editor plugin icons

### Color Constraints
- **Maximum 3 colors** for simplicity
- Must work in both light and dark themes
- Should have a single-color variant
- Avoid colors requiring specialized color profiles

## Design Preferences

### Visual Style
- **Modern but timeless** - Avoid trendy effects that will date quickly
- **Technical yet approachable** - Not too abstract, not too playful
- **Sophisticated simplicity** - Clean lines, thoughtful composition
- **Professional** - Suitable for enterprise environments

### Metaphor Treatment
- **Subtle over literal** - Evoke grafting without showing realistic plant surgery
- **Abstract geometric** - Prefer geometric abstraction to illustrated realism
- **Symbolic** - Icons/symbols preferred over wordmarks or illustrated scenes

### Composition Approach
Consider these compositional strategies:
1. **Pure symbol/icon** - Standalone mark (like Git's branching diagram)
2. **Lettermark** - Stylized "G" with grafting elements
3. **Combined mark** - Icon + text (separable components)
4. **Geometric pattern** - Abstract pattern suggesting synthesis/grafting

## Evaluation Rubric

Rate each logo concept on these dimensions (1-5 scale):

### 1. Brand Alignment (1-5)
Does it capture the essence of Graft?
- Grafting/synthesis metaphor
- Git/version control foundation
- AI-powered orchestration
- Professional developer tool

### 2. Scalability (1-5)
Does it work at all sizes?
- Clear at 16x16 (favicon)
- Effective at 48x48 (icons)
- Impressive at 200px+ (README)
- No loss of meaning when scaled

### 3. Versatility (1-5)
Does it adapt to different contexts?
- Light and dark backgrounds
- Monochrome rendering
- Square and rectangular crops
- Print and digital media

### 4. Memorability (1-5)
Will people remember it?
- Distinctive shape/form
- Unique in tools landscape
- Visual hook or surprise
- Easy to describe/recall

### 5. Simplicity (1-5)
Is it appropriately simple?
- Clean, uncluttered
- Reproducible (could you sketch it?)
- Not overly complex
- Elegant restraint

### 6. Technical Execution (1-5)
Is it well-crafted?
- Clean SVG code
- Proper geometric construction
- Balanced proportions
- Attention to detail

### 7. Longevity (1-5)
Will it age well?
- Timeless vs. trendy
- Room to evolve with brand
- Professional at scale
- Won't need redesign soon

## Success Criteria

A successful logo should:
- Score ≥4.0 average across all rubric dimensions
- Score ≥4 on Brand Alignment and Scalability (non-negotiable)
- Have at least one "signature" element (the thing people remember)
- Work in monochrome without loss of meaning
- Be embeddable in README with minimal code
- Feel right when you see it with the name "Graft"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Visual Clichés
- Generic tree diagrams (overdone in tech)
- Standard git branch visualizations (too literal)
- Gradient orbs/blobs (dated web 2.0 aesthetic)
- Overly complex line art (doesn't scale)
- Corporate swooshes (generic)

### Execution Problems
- Too many colors (hard to reproduce)
- Requires specific fonts (portability issues)
- Photographic/raster elements (not truly scalable)
- Trendy effects (drop shadows, gradients, 3D)
- Illegible at small sizes

### Conceptual Missteps
- Too abstract (no connection to brand)
- Too literal (botanical illustration)
- Too playful (undermines professional credibility)
- Too similar to existing tools (Git, DVC, etc.)

## Inspiration and References

### Exemplary Developer Tool Logos
- **Git**: Simple branching diagram, instantly recognizable
- **Docker**: Whale + containers, playful but professional
- **Rust**: Interlocking gears, suggests performance and precision
- **VS Code**: Geometric chevron, modern and clean
- **Kubernetes**: Helm wheel, nautical metaphor well-executed

### Visual Themes to Explore
1. **Grafting junction** - The moment where two parts unite
2. **Branch convergence** - Multiple paths becoming one
3. **Layered synthesis** - Stacking/overlapping elements
4. **Node connections** - Network/graph visualization
5. **Geometric growth** - Organic forms in geometric style

### Color Psychology for Developer Tools
- **Blues/Teals**: Trust, reliability, technical (common but effective)
- **Greens**: Growth, synthesis, natural processes
- **Purples**: Innovation, transformation, premium
- **Oranges/Ambers**: Energy, warmth, approachable
- **Monochrome**: Timeless, elegant, versatile

## Logo Variants to Consider

For each design concept, consider these variants:

1. **Full color** - Primary brand expression
2. **Monochrome** - Single color (black or brand color)
3. **Reversed** - Light version for dark backgrounds
4. **Icon only** - Symbol without text (for favicons, small contexts)
5. **Horizontal lockup** - Icon + text side-by-side
6. **Stacked lockup** - Icon above text

## Next Steps in the Process

1. **Visual metaphor exploration** - Identify 3-5 core visual concepts
2. **Symbol concept generation** - Create 10-15 rough symbol sketches
3. **Color palette development** - Develop 2-3 palette options
4. **Composition refinement** - Refine top 3-5 concepts
5. **Evaluation** - Score against rubric, gather feedback
6. **Final recommendation** - Select winner, create variants, provide SVG code
