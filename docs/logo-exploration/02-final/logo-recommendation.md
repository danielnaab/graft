# Final Logo Recommendation

Based on the comprehensive exploration and evaluation, **Angular Y-Junction with Binding Wrap** is the recommended logo for Graft.

## 1. The Recommended Logo

### Concept Name
**Angular Y-Junction with Binding Wrap**

### Visual Description
The Graft logo features a clean, geometric Y-shaped structure where two angled branches converge at 55° into a single vertical trunk. At the junction point, three horizontal rectangular bands wrap around the convergence, creating an unmistakable visual reference to botanical grafting technique. The design uses consistent 3-unit stroke weights at a 100-unit scale, with the junction positioned at 40% from the top (approximating the golden ratio) for optimal visual balance.

The branches extend 35 units each from their starting points, meeting at the wrap junction, while the trunk continues 45 units downward, creating a stable, directional composition. The wrap bands are 1.5 units tall, spaced 2 units apart, and extend 6 units beyond the branch width on each side to ensure clear definition of the binding metaphor.

**Color application** uses the Rooted Growth palette: deep Forest Anchor green (#2C5F2D) for the branches and trunk, with Grafted Sage (#7A9B76) for the wrap bands. This creates clear visual hierarchy—the structure in deep professional green, the binding action in softer sage—while maintaining the botanical metaphor throughout.

**Visual metaphor**: The Y-junction represents git's branching and merging workflows, multiple documentation sources converging. The wrap bands symbolize the grafting action—Graft's synthesis of disparate elements into a unified whole, the careful orchestration that binds components together.

## 3. Why This Logo

### Brand Essence
This logo perfectly captures Graft's essence through a direct yet elegant visual metaphor. The Y-junction immediately evokes git's branching and merging paradigm—the foundational version control DNA of Graft. The wrap bands transform this from a simple branch diagram into an unmistakable grafting symbol, representing Graft's unique value: the careful, deliberate synthesis and orchestration of documentation sources. This isn't just merging; it's grafting—combining disparate elements with intention and craft to create something stronger than the sum of its parts.

The botanical metaphor grounds the brand in organic growth and natural processes while the geometric execution signals technical precision and engineering rigor. This duality—organic yet engineered, natural yet intentional—perfectly reflects Graft's positioning as an AI-powered tool that brings human-like orchestration intelligence to technical documentation workflows.

### Design Excellence
With a perfect 5.0/5 evaluation score, this logo excels across every dimension. The binding wrap provides a unique signature element that immediately distinguishes Graft in the developer tools landscape—no competitor uses this visual language. The geometric simplicity ensures perfect scalability from 16px favicons to 512px hero images without loss of clarity or meaning. The design demonstrates exceptional restraint: it uses only the elements necessary to communicate the concept, resulting in an ~800 byte file size and a logo anyone can sketch from memory after seeing once.

The golden ratio positioning (junction at 40% from top) and careful optical adjustments (slightly heavier trunk at 3.5 units vs. 3-unit branches) show sophisticated attention to visual balance and proportion. The wrap bands extending beyond the branch edges ensure the binding metaphor reads clearly even at small sizes.

### Practical Advantages
This logo's geometric simplicity translates to exceptional practical performance. At 16x16px favicon sizes, it gracefully simplifies to a Y-shape with a single horizontal accent bar while remaining instantly recognizable. The simple SVG construction using only `<line>` and `<rect>` primitives means clean code, fast rendering, tiny file sizes, and perfect reproducibility across all browsers and contexts.

The design works flawlessly in monochrome (simply increasing wrap band weight provides distinction without color), inverts perfectly for dark mode (lightening to #97BC62 maintains all relationships), and prints crisply in any medium. The timeless geometric forms ensure this logo will remain fresh and professional for decades—this is a 20-year logo, not a 2-year logo.

### Differentiation
In a developer tools landscape dominated by abstract geometric shapes (Docker's whale, Kubernetes' helm), lowercase wordmarks (git, npm), or lettermarks (VS Code's stylized brackets, GitHub's Octocat), the wrapped Y-junction stands completely apart. The botanical grafting reference is unique while remaining immediately understandable. The wrap bands create a visual hook that makes the logo memorable and describable in a single sentence: "It's a Y-shape with bands wrapped around the junction."

The earthy Forest Anchor green further differentiates from the sea of blues (Docker, Azure, VS Code), purples (GitHub), and oranges (git, GitLab) in the space, while maintaining professional developer tool credibility.

## 4. Usage Guidelines

### Size Recommendations
- **Minimum size**: 16x16px (favicon) - use icon-only variant with single wrap band
- **Small icons** (32-48px): Use full logo, all three wrap bands visible
- **Standard display** (64-200px): Primary usage size, optimal detail visibility
- **Large display** (256px+): Scales perfectly, can add subtle texture or effects if desired

### Color Variants Usage
- **Full color** (logo.svg): Primary usage in documentation, README, marketing materials, light backgrounds
- **Monochrome** (logo-monochrome.svg): Single-color printing, contexts without color support, simplified reproduction
- **Reversed/Dark** (logo-dark.svg): GitHub dark mode, dark documentation themes, presentations on dark backgrounds
- **Icon-only** (logo-icon.svg): Favicons, app icons, social media profile images, tight spaces

### Background Recommendations
- **Light backgrounds** (#FFFFFF, #F5F5F5): Use full color variant (logo.svg)
- **Dark backgrounds** (#1E1E1E, #000000): Use reversed variant (logo-dark.svg) with lightened greens
- **Colored backgrounds**: Use monochrome variant in contrasting color, or test full color for sufficient contrast
- **Ensure minimum 3:1 contrast ratio** against background for all applications

### Embedding in README

Example markdown snippet for optimal README display:

```markdown
<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/logo.svg" alt="Graft Logo" width="200">
  <h1>Graft</h1>
  <p>Git-native documentation orchestration system</p>
</div>
```

Or simple inline:
```markdown
![Graft Logo](docs/logo.svg)
```

For GitHub dark mode compatibility, use HTML with picture element:
```html
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/logo-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/logo.svg" alt="Graft Logo" width="200">
</picture>
```

### Spacing and Clear Space
- **Minimum clear space**: 10% of logo height on all sides (e.g., 10px clear space for 100px logo)
- **Lockup spacing**: If creating text lockup, maintain 15-20% of symbol width between symbol and text
- **Avoid crowding**: Logo should breathe—give it space to be noticed and recognized

## 5. Alternative Options

### Alternative 1: Split-G with Junction Detail
- **Score**: 4.29/5
- **Strengths**: Sophisticated lettermark that serves dual function as icon and brand initial. The cut-and-rejoined metaphor elegantly embeds the grafting concept within the letter G. Highly professional aesthetic suitable for enterprise contexts. Excellent monochrome performance.
- **When to consider**: If you want the logo to also function as a decorative initial in the wordmark, or if you prefer a more sophisticated, designer-forward aesthetic. Best choice if brand name recognition through letterform is a priority.
- **SVG available**: Yes (see evaluation document for full code)

### Alternative 2: Tributary Convergence (Simplified)
- **Score**: 3.86/5
- **Strengths**: Unique organic aesthetic that stands apart from typical geometric developer tool logos. Beautiful synthesis metaphor with progressive convergence (5→3→1 paths). Memorable visual narrative of sources flowing together.
- **When to consider**: If you want maximum differentiation and warmth, or if the tool will expand beyond developer audiences to creative professionals. Would require simplification to three paths maximum for better scalability.

## 6. File Organization
