# Graft

**Git-native documentation that grafts together as your sources evolve**

</div>

## Overview

Graft is an LLM-powered documentation pipeline that intelligently synthesizes Markdown documents from multiple sources. Like grafting branches in horticulture, Graft binds together content from different origins—code, specifications, research, strategy—into unified documents that grow and adapt as your sources change.

Built on git and DVC, Graft tracks what changed in your repository and applies surgical updates: when sources evolve, it incorporates new content while preserving existing structure. When instructions change, it regenerates entirely. The result is living documentation that stays synchronized with your project without manual rewriting.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent change detection** - Distinguishes between source updates and instruction changes, applying appropriate regeneration strategies
- **Multi-level documentation hierarchies** - Generated documents can serve as inputs to other prompts, creating cascading documentation DAGs
- **Git-native workflow** - All prompts, sources, and outputs are version controlled; DVC manages the pipeline execution
- **AWS Bedrock integration** - Leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5 for high-quality synthesis with flexible authentication (profiles, SSO, env vars)
- **Minimal regeneration** - Only affected documents rebuild when dependencies change; unchanged sections stay byte-identical
- **Auto-generated pipelines** - Define dependencies in prompt frontmatter; Graft generates the DVC configuration automatically

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build Graft
git clone <graft-repo>
cd graft
make build

# Set up your project
cd ../your-project
cp .env.example .env  # Configure AWS credentials (or use ~/.aws)
bin/graft init

# Create your first document
bin/graft new executive-summary strategy
# Edit docs/strategy/executive-summary.prompt.md with deps and instructions
bin/graft rebuild
```
